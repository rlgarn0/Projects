### Executive Summary

As the tech space moves into every sector of the economy, more companies are trying to find an edge in a that space. Of the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) Real Estate is one of the least automated. Depending on realtors to show homes, appraisers to estimate values. The could be a key market for a tech take over. Models are used to predict insurance risks and indexed funds beat most human managed funds on the stock market. This set forth to see if housing prices could be modeled as when. 
A training data set was taken in and cleaned. Features were added and dropped and modified. A set of feature was determined by measuring their correlation to home prices. After this different models were ran against the data to see which one produced the best fit. A model was selected and fit to the training data then ran on test data. These scores were compared to ensure that the model was not overfit to the training data. Then the model was ran on unseen data and check by a third party to verify accuracy. 




### Conclusions:

SAT and ACT participation are inversely correlated. By looking at states that have low SAT participation rates and have a high population, I was able to narrow a range of target states. Also by looking at the legal requirements	of those states. Arizona is the best choice to pursue spending money to increase participation. They have already have an option to replace standardized testing with the SAT or ACT, their current program is not inline with federal law and the could lose up to 340 million dollars if they do not comply. This is a good time to try to convince the state that they should replace standardized testing for juniors with the SAT.
