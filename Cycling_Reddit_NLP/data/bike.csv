[Another amateur (ex-pro) tests positive at big Italian granfondo style race.](https://granfondodailynews.com/2019/07/10/sportful-dolomite-gran-fondo-winner-fails-drug-test/)  Does anyone really think amateur racing is clean anymore??  Chances are pretty good you compete against a doper every time you toe the line at a granfondo, USAC, BritishCycling, etc. race.  Even with riders knowing amateur granfondo races in Europe always testing top finishers, results keep coming back positive.  The UK and USA test even fewer amateur riders. We're not talking sophisticated dopers following a fancy regimen, just everyday amateur dopers with an overwhelming need to win.  This guy certainly knew he would be tested and come up positive, but he couldn't  stop himself from rolling across the finish line 1st with an arms-up victory salute.",1

4,"What should my goal weight be? So I started at 184 lbs in march, and now i've managed to get down to 159 lbs, while also gaining 5 watts on my FTP (205-&gt;210). I can feel SUCH a difference on climbs due to the staggering difference in power to weight, but i'm wondering where I should aim to stop losing weight. My original goal is 155, but should I be targeting 150? 145? I don't do a TON of climbing, so i'd like to err on the side of more raw power (210 is still SO FREAKIN FAR below my goal power), but at what weight does that choice even start being a thing? I am 5'8"" with something like 16-18% body fat (i'll get a more accurate number for this soon).

It feels like these zones are a little off though but I’m just an amateur racer with very little experience in these matters.  Does 181 seem like the right LTHR for a 22 year old with max HR of 198 and resting HR of 52?  And does those zones seem right?

Positioning and your place in the field is absolutely critical in bike racing, and often is the deciding factor in who stands on the podium and who doesn't. However, there's plenty of riders out there who may understand its importance but not the mechanics of how to move up and around in a field — this is for them.

2. When should you move up in the field? When should you drop back?

You can find my livestream on the website: [https://getontherivet.com](https://getontherivet.com/) and also on Twitch: [https://www.twitch.tv/the\_rivet](https://www.twitch.tv/the_rivet)   I'd love to get some feedback from some hardcore cyclists about whether a game like this might inspire you to train harder, or if you would find it a distraction?

I am of course wanting to publicise what I'm doing, but it is such early  days (no team, just me in my bedroom working like a madman for the past three months) so really what I want more than anything is honest  feedback.

And for those that don't know what Zwift is, it's essentially an indoor training tool for cyclists. [www.zwift.com](https://www.zwift.com/)

My idea differs in three key ways:

1. Steering  and braking. Collapsing the cycling experience into one degree of  freedom (power) is to me a huge mistake. I love cycling because it's  technical and tactical.
2. Much  shorter-format track style races: elimination, madison, team sprint,  points races etc. I do like the idea of cycling in a massive world with  others (like Zwift) but I think that novelty actually wears off quite  quickly. What I want are formats which inspire me to work hard, and  actually have fun in the process.
3. An  accurate physics engine for drafting, turning etc. You're not going to  get a fun steering experience without accurate physics, and drafting is  Zwift is pretty far from realistic IMHO.",1

63,"Pre, during and post nutrition / supplements Hi, all,

I was fairly careless regarding nutrition and decided to step-up in this regard. Read a lot on Internet but there are still some unclear areas so I hoped you might share your ideas.

1. Pre-ride: I usually eat oatmeal 1-2h prior, then Beta-Alanine (which seems to work fine for me) and used to have matte tea (caffeine). Now I consider switching tea for a) energy shot (caffeine, carnitine, etc.) and/or b) 50g of carbohydrate powder (SiS GO Energy). Do you benefit from either of it? Should I use them both or is that overkill?
2. During-ride: I used to eat bananas with regular flapjacks. Recently tried gels with sport-specific flapjacks and I am super happy about it as gels can store more energy than banana in same volume and sport flapjacks are much easier to eat. On longer rides I use basic electrolyte tabs (no caffeine, no sugar). Any other ideas? Is there any benefit of caffeine consumption during ride in either electrolyte drink or caffeinated gels?
3. Post-ride: I hit regular whey protein drink with  milk and banana immediatelly after workout with normal meal in like 30 mins after. Are there any real benefits from BCAA shots or cycling specific recovery drinks (SiS REGO)? I consider switching whey protein for specific recovery drink.
4. Any other ideas? Supplements or natural foods worth looking into? I tried energy electrolyte drinks, but it's just too sweet for me.

My goal is to keep engine running for longer rides and with my old nutrition I used to ran out of fuel in 3-3.5 hours. I believe simply carrying more food and eating more should help, but any enhancements in performance/recovery thanks to specific supplements are welcome. Thanks for all comments.

TL;DR:

1. Do you feel any benefits from caffeine/carnitine shots and/or carbohydrate pre-ride drinks?
2. Do you feel any benefits from BCAA shots or recovery post-ride drinks (vs. regular whey protein)?
3. Do you feel any benefits from caffeine consumption during ride? If yes, how much and in what form you have it?

I'm in my 40s and just discovered Strava segments. I know I'm late to the game, but I'm having a blast trying to complete against the times. This is the most competitive and motivated I've felt cycling since I was in my 20s. I've raced but I've never followed a training program... I would just get out and ride. The only training I would do is high cadence sprint intervals where I'd work to hit and maintain max possible speed in the small chainring, and hold it for 30 to 60s.

I'm also into Olympic weightlifting. It's been a few years since I've competed, but the cycling sprints are motivating me to up my power, so I've started working my squats and cleans back up. I have a lot of experience with lifting programming, but never while cycling at the same time. Not really sure how to do both.

**Question:** Does anybody know of any good resources for building up a basic sprint/bursty power focused cycling program? It seems like track coaches do this kind of stuff all the time, but I'm striking out with Google. Most road cycling training seems to be endurance oriented.

Training for \~2 years and recently developed knee pain. This year (unfortunately) I had to stick to trainer till end of May (\~4-5 hours a week). Started strong with \~500km in first 8 days of June, and, well, knee pain (never experienced this before) :(

It's probably a ""spring knee"" syndrome, that's what my physio says. He's also a bikefitter. The pain is in the inner front part of the knee, starts after \~0,5-1 hour of riding and when I do too much, it hurts after too. Always when I flex my leg. And while riding when the pain starts it doesn't matter if I push hard or not. Actually I think it even hurts less when power is high.

Read as much as I could about this but can't find answer to one thing. How long does it take to heal? I took 7 days off, went for a ride and after 30 mins it started hurting again. And every time since then it's the same. I have no idea what to do. Ride or not ride? And if not, then how long does it take to go away.

I foam roll, etc, do stretching and stuff, I also booked bike-fitting session. But have a summer camp planned in 10 days and it would be a nightmare if the knee didn't heal.

Two things I couldn't figure out are:

1.) During weekends I will obviously do long endurance rides, but what should I do during workweek? Normally I ride several max effort (given the lenght of interval) 10-30 min intervals with recovery in between. Should I continue with hard intervals or focus on 1-2 hours of sustained effort similar to what I will do during the event ?

2.) The longest climb in my area is 35 min effort. So if I am supposed to train sustained efforts, is it okay if I do it on flat? Is there any difference between riding 90% of FTP on flat vs on climb? I mean in theory watts are all that matters, but intuition tells me that riding hills should prepare me better for riding hills, no?

**Tl,dr:** What's better preparation for long climbs? Riding similar efforts watt-wise but on flat OR riding shorter hills repetitively but ofc with rest in between?

 (today i managed to stay in the peloton until the last lap on a hilly circuit tho so still quite happy about that)

&amp;#x200B;

I do know i'm usually cardio bound (unless its a 20min all out effort, there i feel my legs burning) because on training rides when there is a climb i'm always the one breathing heavily (sometimes for quite a long time) while everyone else on my level usually get dropped because of their legs it seem.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the races i have done, it's worse because i can't gauge the effort, i don't know because it's been hot recently or because i'm excited during racing or a combination of different factor but all my effort feel like z2 or z3 in my legs.

For example in my second race, 20 minutes in, i said to myself ""well i feel really good and easy, maybe i should attack"", then i proceed to watch my cardio number and ouch 186 (my max is 191), 15 minutes later i got dropped.

As many probably predicted, I crashed out! How neat.

____

Prep:

I actually managed to secure a fantastic deal on a bike, so you'll be happy to hear that I did not use my single speed for the race. I'll concede that I was very silly to even entertain that thought, cus my downhill speeds would have been pathetic lol. 
I've been riding with my new bike, learning how to be most efficient, and really loving it. Took the week before to rest and reduce fatigue, went in feeling really good.
(I also did a velo class and did a noobie race night a couple weeks back which was great pack riding experience).

____

The race:

Got to the course a couple hours early to take the Beginners Clinic that was offered. Really good information on cornering, the course, and staying organized. 
I started relatively in the middle of the pack and made some moves following strong looking individuals to get close to the front. I was told that would be the safest place so I wanted to stick near the front group.

I did so for the 6.5 laps I was in. Managed to stay around 10th. My fitness was absolutely more than adequate. I wasn't having much trouble at all sticking with. On the 2nd or 3rd lap an individual let me know that I was doing a poor job holding my lines, and need to be more aware of my horizontal moves with whats around me. I really appreciated that because it wasn't something I was conscious of. From that point on I focused more on it.

On the back side of the 6th lap right as the hill began, an individual attacked up in between me and the curb on the outside. As he passed he bumped me and I lost control, resulting in my front wheel hitting his back wheel. I did what I could and directed myself toward the bushes and crashed over the curb. I won't pretend to have the 360 degree awareness to say if I was at fault or he, but I am glad that I was able to both not hurt anyone else, and walk away with minimal damage to myself and bike. I definitely feel that an individual with much better bike handling skills probably could have resisted the bump better than I did, or salvaged the resulting wobble better. That's the only solid information I have for the situation.

______

Conclusion:

+I definitely have the fitness and my training has been more than adequate, which is really good information. I had no problem hanging with the lead group and responding to surges. I never quite hit my max heartrate, and was averaging around 90%.

-I need to find someone knowledgeable and try to debrief on the crash and learn from it. At this point I am really not sure how I should have handled it better. Besides that I did gain some good understanding in regards to my weaknesses in group riding and maintaining a calm predictable line. 

I'll be participating in another crit very soon. I really want to pursue this.",1

151,"Quick Catlike Whisper Road and Catlike Whisper Oval MTB review Hi there!  


After buying the catlike whisper road (2017 model), I fell in love with the model since it fits my foot perfect. Bought the MTB version too called Whisper Oval MTB (2019 model) .

For what it looked like at the retailer, the road version of the whisper 2017 is similar to the MTB version. The MTB version of the whisper oval 2019 is similar to the road version. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is very little information about these two shoes online. Thought i would make this post in case someone has any questions about them or is considering buying. Maybe this will help others.. Comment this post and I will answer your question.

&amp;#x200B;

Short review:

Sizing: EU sizes is in full sizes (41, 42, 43 etc.). I normally wear a 42,5/43 in Nike trainers. In this model i got 42. This is for me a performance fit, but I think this is perfect. I got medium wide feet.

&amp;#x200B;

Performance: Very stiff.  IMO, i would say they are ""up there"" with other high-performance shoes. Dunno how I can describe it, but I feel more in contact with the bike. Especially on climbs/sprints. Set new FTP-PR with them :)

&amp;#x200B;

Comfort: Been testing them in short+fast and slow+long. No blisters or hot spots. A small discomfort in outer part of foot, just below the little toe, has occured. I blame myself for over-tightening on a long ride. Only con I can find with the shoes (and it is minor) is that if I tighten it reeeally tight, the tongue can make a small fold that could create blisters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other: Very airy and good ventilation. The road shoe gets cold if its under 15 degrees, due to the venting.. MTB shoe is a little warmer.

&amp;#x200B;

More to come when I have time.

My typical schedule is Monday recovery, Tuesday intervals or training crit, Wednesday B pace group ride, Thursday intervals or training crit, Friday recovery, Saturday endurance ride, Sunday off.

My question relates to the Tuesday and Thursday options to either do training crits or structured interval training. I've heard people say racing isn't training but I can't see how gassing myself in training crits with Cat 3 riders doesn't count. For example, last Thursday in the training crit I averaged 233 Watts for 72 minutes with an NP of 256. At this point in my racing I know I need both crit experience and to increase my recovery and sprint power so do these training crits check the box for both handling and pack racing experience AND recovery work? Would it be better to do intervals one day and the training crit the other? Can I really go wrong either way as long as I'm getting in good miles at this stage of my racing?  

  

Edit:  Thanks all for the advice, I was hoping to hear that I should hit the practice crits, they're way more fun than doing structured intervals and since there are much faster guys it's always a workout.

193,"Join my London Based Cycling/Nutrition Study! Hello All!

My name is Matt, I'm a PhD student based in London and am studying how changes in nutrition can impact health, well being and cycling performance (both steady state, time trials and sprints), specifically looking at a six week ketogenic diet intervention.

I'm running a study looking at nutrition strategies, in an attempt to further our knowledge of how this impacts physiology and exercise performance.

It would be great to get as many people involved as possible; you don't have to be an elite athlete, just a keen cyclist and physically active individual who is able to attend our lab in South West London to do some steady state and time trial based cycling tests, as well as body composition tests and health questionnaires. You will take part in a 6 week baseline phase where you don't have to change diet at all, and then follow a ketogenic diet for 6 weeks.

The data generated would be really useful for the cycling community and would also provide some really interesting data on your own exercise performance, looking at how a standard diet compared to a keto diet impacts endurance and sprint performance, as well as fat/carbohydrate burning and oxygen consumption. This may help you take your performance to the next level, with some key factors that will be studied being:

* Overall time to completion, and how diet changes influence this
* Body composition monitoring
* Substrate oxidation (fat/carb burning) both at low intensity and during a time trial
* Lactate and glucose values throughout the exercise and at rest

Participating in the study would offer value by revealing the fuelling strategies that you best respond to, in particular how the ketogenic diet impacts performance compared to your standard diet, as well as how much fat/carbohydrate you're burning at low and high intensities.

If you'd like to learn more about the study, or inquire about participating then please do send me an email at [k1408169@kingston.ac.uk](mailto:k1408169@kingston.ac.uk) with the subject line 'Cycling Study'.",1

The problem I'm having is that, as my endurance has improved, it's taking me around an hour of riding to feel warmed up and comfortable sitting in Z2. After this point it's almost like something clicks and suddenly I can sit at mid-Z2 seemingly forever.

What I'm wondering is, if any of you have any tricks or ideas for warming up a bit faster. Up until I'm warmed up, having my HR at the high end of Z1 feels really blah. I don't have a power meter to compare, but I'm pretty sure my speed/power is about the same before and after warming up, but I just can't get my heart rate up.

So does that mean that your slow twitch fibers get stronger when you become more fit, and your muscles are therefore able to produce more power and force without having to engange fast twitch fibers.

I test my FTP inside every 3 weeks.  I don't think I'm that great at the test.  I was at 228 4 weeks ago and 228 1 week ago.  At the end of the aforementioned 1 hour effort, I pushed up a gradual incline and What's My FTP? said I was at 231.

&amp;#x200B;

So.. I'm imagining my FTP has climbed higher, but I just didn't test well.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you all do for the next week prior to your next test?  Just increase intensity a bit during my interval sessions?  Maybe 100% instead of 95%?  


Edit:

And just to be clear I'm not worried that my FTP isn't increasing, I think it is.. and I need to understand how to interpret my fitness level and modify my workouts mid-cycle.

I'm 52 and am slowly increasing intensity. So the amount of time I'm spending doing higher intensity work is OK based on what I've worked up to.",1

234,"Why obsess over bike weight so much? (And some physics) Edit: This post is not to attack anyone for buying expensive bikes - my main concern is the performance difference between lighter and heavier wheels. Can heavier wheels have performance benefits in some races?

I am new to biking and I see people (20h/wk competitive bikers but also 7h/wk hobby bikers) obsess over a four pound difference in bike weight between two bikes - where the lighter bike is obviously a lot more expensive in most cases. 


I mean, you can easily manipulate your own weight through sodium intake and so forth come race day. And, most of us probably are at least four pounds heavier than optimal. Yet, this sort of body weight manipulation isn't mentioned as much - which is strange since body weight manipulation doesn't cost any money at all. 


--


So what am I missing? Is four pounds in bike weight *not* equivalent to four pounds in body weight? 


From a physics standpoint - we can picture body+bike as an one-body-system where the internal forces (foot against the pedal, hands against the bar and butt against the sadle) sums to zero. 


What determines the *acceleration* of this one-body-system is the *net force* in the direction of traveling and the *total mass* (this is my main point) of the one-body-system.  This is also known as Newtons' Second Law. 


The net-force is just the sum of all the force components in the direction of traveling. The forces that propels you forward is the friction between ground and tire -  but also gravity (when downhill) or if you are lucky *negative* air resistance. 


So my point is the acceleration of body+bike follows Newtons' Second Law: 


*Force=Mass***Acceleration*


where the Mass is the sum of body weight and bike weight. 


Now, according to Newtons' law above, the only way to increase acceleration for a given mass is to increase the force. So the only way ""four pounds bike weight isn't equal to four pounds body weight"" could be true is if a lighter bike somehow gives a bigger net force for the same effort. 


--


The conclusion above doesn't make much sense - so I suspect the solution to my problem exists in the *wheels*.


When you are accelerating your bike a lot of energy is lost to rotational energy of the wheels. This means that if you were floating with your bike above the ground you would still feel a resistance when pedaling since the angular acceleration of the wheels requires a torque. 


So when you are accelerating your bike a lot of energy will be stored as rotational energy of the wheels. The heavier the wheels the more energy will be required for a given angular acceleration. Also, if the mass of the wheels is spread out over a bigger circle/diameter - more energy will be required for a given angular acceleration (more torque is required when mass is further away from the center of rotation). 


This leads us the conclusion that a bike with *lighter wheels with a smaller diameter* will not store as much rotational energy for a given *angular velocity* of the wheels (rotations per unit time). But, wheels with a smaller diameter will give less bike speed for a given rotational speed of the wheels - so I'm not sure how important wheel diameter is when accelerating. It might be a zero sum game. 


So, a bike with lighter wheels will not require as much torque for a given acceleration - which means that less energy will be ""wasted"" as rotational energy when you are spinning up the wheels. However, while it might be true that accelerating the bike with lighter wheels will be easier - less energy stored as rotational energy for a given bike speed means that the wheels will stop spinning faster if you were to stop pedaling. Less rotational energy means that it *will be harder to keep your current speed*. Air resistance will destroy the rotational energy much faster if you have less rotational energy to begin with. 


In summary, it seems that a bike with lighter wheels will accelerate faster but will not store as much energy as rotational energy for a given bike speed - which means that if you have lighter wheels your bike would deaccelerate faster if you were to stop pedaling. So even if the total mass of bike+body is the same regardless of bike weight - a bike with heavier wheels will not deaccelerate as much when you stop pedaling. 


So is bigger acceleration (lighter wheels) more useful than less deacceleration (heavier wheels)? 


Maybe one of you with a knowledge in physics and/or more cycling experience than me could answer this?",1

There is some rust in the aluminum interface and even after soaking in some sort of degreaser when they tried to remove it, they ended up breaking the special tool that Mavic provides to remove it. 

They called Mavic to ask if they would sell them a replacement part so that they could just cut off the part that was rusted and they said they were not willing to do that. So now apparently they can only replace the drive side bearings and not the non-drive side.  

The shitty thing about this is that these wheels are &lt; 2 years old. The reason I needed the bearings replaced is because there is lateral play in my back wheel in the first place.   


So the question: what would you do here? I don't really want to go out and spend on another set of rim break wheels when my next bike will be disc for sure...

It feels more difficult, even though my HR and power are pretty much the same. I'm guessing that this is becasue the muscles are working slightly differently. But is there any benefit to doing this on some indoor rides, to for example improve speed on false flats and climbs, or does it not matter?",1

About an hour ago, I was training my max one minute power, and managed to hold a power that was far higher than what I usually can do. Obviously my heart was beating through my chest (200bpm- never been that high before). However as I sat up after the interval I immediately had a head rush, which has happened before, but this time I almost fainted. Caught myself, and immediately got off the bike. Walked towards the water fountain and checked my heart rate- 195. It stayed at 195bpm for about 3 minutes then dropped to 190 and stayed there for another 5. I felt myself blacking out a couple times but managed to keep it together. All the while feeling incredibly dizzy, tingling sensations in my face, etc. After that it just started dropping to normal levels. Probably the scariest 8 minutes of my life. I'm 22 years old.

I used to live in a very hilly with long steep climbs and descents area so the ""climbing"" wheels made sense when I chose them over the 50 deep rims, but moved since to mostly flat - rolling hills area, so am considering getting a set of  carbon wheels, 50 mm , that would be around 1000 euro.

I was thinking about adding some longer efforts (maybe sweetspots.. maybe just some longer race pace rides); keeping the 6 min intervals; and dropping the short intervals.

Questions
1.  Should overall TSS go up?
1.  Should overall hours on the bike to up or down?
1.  Joe Friel suggests ( in Fast after 50) adding aerobic threshold rides which he describes as longer rides 30 min - 4 hours at 30 bpm under Lactate Threshold Heart Rate.


Currently, I'm training about 7 hours a week and doing about 1 hour of intervals spread across two days.  So, 

* Mon - Off
* Tues - 3 intervals of 6 min with 2 min recovery. Followed by about an hour of recovery ride
* Wed - 1.5 hour recovery ride
* Thur - 7 intervals of 1 min with 1 min recovery, followed by about an hour of recovery 
* Fri - Off
* Sat - 2.5 hour Fast ""ish"" group ride
* Sun - 1.5 hour recovery

So far this has been going well.  I had a large jump in TSS at one point and got sick for about a week.  But have increased TSS more slowly lately and am feeling pretty good with the workload.  My FTP has gone from 195 when I started in Feb to 228 today.",1

This leaves the Schwalbe vs Continental for more of a fast everyday tire. The GP 5000 TL is about 40g heavier than the Schwalbe, but beats it in RR by about 3watts. Puncture resistance should be similar.

368,"Power Meter Calibration Differences  For anyone who has owned more than one power meter and used them a lot, have you noticed big difference in power readings ?  


Have owned a Power2Max for years and used it loads (and its still going strong). Bought a 4iii precision recently which I use on the race bike and keep the P2M on the training/winter bike (use to regularly swap the P2M between bikes).  


Anyway on steady Z2 spins the 4iii reads 10+ watts lower. This isn't scientific as I cannot test them both together. However when you've done the same route for years and compare other metrics such as speed and heart rate, differences soon become apparent.  


And when racing difference are even bigger. Attached is an image of a Strava segment of a club race I've done several times over the years. It shows 13 power readings, 12 with the P2M and then last nights with the new 4iii. Last night was second fastest in the list with HR normal race levels and I'm certainly not lighter than previous years. Yet power is 25+ watts lower. That's 10% !

This post is gonna be a bit lengthy, so I apologize in advance!

So a while back I [posted ](https://reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/9uq7zs/training_for_an_insane_climb/)asking for advice on tackling an insane climb I had found near where I would be studying in Ecuador. I posted a [follow up](https://reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/awa1q8/update_on_gnarly_climb_in_ecuador/) after my climb attempt, and while it didn't go as well as I would have liked, it was still an incredible experience. There was lots of helpful advice and encouragement on those posts, which was much appreciated. I think this community is really awesome. 

In the process of learning more about the climb I was going to be doing in Ecuador, I started working with a relatively new online cycling startup called [PJAMM Cycling ](https://pjammcycling.com/), who's goal is to rank and document the hardest bike climbs all over the world. I think what PJAMM is doing is super exciting and helpful to cyclists who love a good adventure. After my time in Ecuador, PJAMM Cycling sent me to Colombia for a week to document 3 tough climbs there that are all ranked in their worldwide top 100 hardest list. Check out their site to read about the climbs I did in Ecuador and Colombia, and also other crazy climbs around the world! 

On Thursday morning, I am heading out on another adventure and flying to Asia to document a bunch more climbs for PJAMM's site. Over the course of about 2 weeks, we are going to be doing 10 climbs throughout Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan, with 7 of the climbs being ranked in the top 100 hardest in the world. Here are a few points about the trip that have me the most stoked:

* 10 climbs, 178 miles of climbing, and 58,284ft gained throughout 3 different countries. 
* 4 climbs up Mt. Fuji, a mountain I have wanted to see my entire life!
* Climbing the world's #2 hardest ranked climb in Taiwan. 8,282ft gained over 15.4 miles. Avg grade of 10%, steepest mile averaging 18.6%, and steepest 1/4 mile averaging 29.56%. Insanity. 

I'm posting this for a few reasons. First, I am looking for any advice or personal tips that people can share with me about optimizing my recovery. Between all of the travel, and the gnarly climbing, I'm fully expecting to be pretty worn down by the end of the trip. I know there are people in this community with much more experience and knowledge than I have, so any tips or advice you can share to help me stay functional during the trip would be really helpful. I am also in the middle of a TrainerRoad plan, and while I'm not worried about losing too much fitness, I'm interested to see how two weeks of unstructured, hard climbing effects me. I am planning to try to do some of my scheduled intervals on the climbs, but it is definitely less of a focus. 

Second, I figured there might be people out there who are interested in following along with the trip! PJAMM has developed a [really cool page ](https://myadventurepage.com/cycling/asia2019)that anyone can check out to learn more about the trip and the climbs that I am going to be doing. I am going to be posting tons of photos and updates to the page, and when I am riding, people will be able to see exactly where I am on the climbs. Additionally, you can also follow [my Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/hmitchr40/)account, as well as [PJAMM Cycling's ](https://instagram.com/pjammcycling?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;igshid=nbzy5gm5o52q)to see what we're up to! 

Sorry again for the long post! Thanks for reading, and if you have any tips for traveling, climbing, recovery or anything like that please leave 'em in the comments.

I felt like there was nothing I could do at that point so I just tried to hug the corner as tightly as I could, but as he drifted over our wheels touched which snapped some spokes and put me into a sewer grate.

I'm not sure I performed them as described, cause Friels Workout confuses me. May you can help me to clarify the workouts.

Muscular force 1: 12-20 Minutes, Zone 4, RPE 5-6
Muscular force 2: 6-12 Minutes, near below FTP, RPE 7-8
FTP is around 94-110% but is Zone 4 at Friel. So what is the difference and how does is come, that the RPE in mf1 is lower than in mf2, when the output of wattage is nearly the same?

The rests are 25% of the duration, so no difference here.

In addition to that: MF2 should be performed for the first time with 2x6 minutes and not more. But mf1 workout is even longer with 12-20 minutes for the first time. I'm aware the mf2 workouts will be extended to 30-50 minutes by time.",1

Hey guys I have been cycling for about a year now and since 4 months I have been doing structured training (exclusively indoors on the turbo apart from leisurely outdoor rides). I have been doing 6 days a week with three of them being 2h at sweet spot with 5 min active recovery and the other three (1h sessions) I have been following some of the gcn training videos for more vo2/anaerobic efforts. I intend to start racing next year and I was thinking I try to get my ftp as high as possible (seems to have worked till now: went from 3 - 4.2w/kg at 50kg) and then shortly before the season do top end work.

Personally, I think starting to race at 18 or 19 is about perfect; maybe even doing it at the club collegiate level. Any earlier seems to risk severe burnout at an early age and in my case there were a few years of rootlessness and dissipation after I quit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been riding pretty seriously for the past 6-7 years (with a year or two hiatus) and have been really itching to get on a new bike and maybe race some crits again.  I used to ride a '06 Trek 5200 and an early 90's steel frame (tange tubing, full campy SR including friction shifters).  I sold the carbon bike about 3 years ago and the steel frame has been my only bike.  Neither of these were ever what I would describe as smooth or comfortable (I think ""compliant"" is the buzzword) and as I am in my mid-30s, a stiff bike is definitely taking its toll on longer rides.  I am getting on the bike much more, and now live in a relatively hilly area (average ride is +/- 30 miles with +/- 2500 feet of climbing).  And of course all the old guys say, ""it's the rider, not the bike"", but a 13-21t rear end with friction shifters wears you out a bit.  Just imagine what I could do with 5 more gears! /s

&amp;#x200B;

So I took a SS Evo (with disc brakes \*fart noise\*) on a spirited test ride which is essentially a spicy 1-hr crit.  My overall opinion of the bike was that it felt soft and more ""endurance"" than what I'm used to.  Admittedly, my previous 2 bikes seemed to have zero comfort in mind in their creation.  So is this ""softness"" that I'm describing actually what I should be looking for?   I know the SS Evo thrives in the hills, which is the basic geography of my area, and a fast flat test ride may not allow the bike shine as much as it could.  As I mentioned, compliance is a word that gets tossed around in this industry and I'm not entirely sure I know what it means.

TLDR: 8 years of old/stiff carbon and steel bikes, test road new carbon bike which felt soft.  With little experience in modern road bikes, is this what the industry calls ""compliance"" and is it something I want?",1

I've decided that i work hard and  therefore its fair enough if i buy myself i nice pair of  carbon wheels as a treat to myself.

Some of that expensive stuff is worth it and other stuff is just hype, trends of the day and marketing. However, if something is worth it and is of a high quality and will last for years, i'm happy to pay good money for it.

Because of this i see a lot of conversations about amateurs over spending and looking like a dentist or showing off. 

I don't want to appear to show off, or feel self conscious and embarrassed. I also love building up my pride and joy to ride as best as it can. My currant bike is a titanium frame, which was expensive but i bought it over a carbon bike because it will last for many years to come.

445,"Best way to train your aerobic fitness or below FTP Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I know there is not single good answer to this question, but wanted to run my thoughts by people on this subreddit to get inputs regarding what is the best way to train your aerobic fitness. I raced for the first time this year (criterium), got dropped about half way through the race and realized that I need to increase my aerobic fitness in order to be competitive. I know there are lot of skill components that I need to work on, which I believe will come with more racing. As for training, I wanted to invest my training time into increasing my aerobic fitness, but while racing here and there this year. My current FTP is 218 w, 3.2 w/kg.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my research this is how I am looking to schedule my weekly training to increase my aerobic fitness:

1. FTP (or threshold workout) 1-1.5 hrs rides during the week days (3 days on Tue, Wed, Th)
2. Long steady distance 4-6 hrs Z2 rides on weekends (2 days, Sat, Sun)

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about also perhaps including VO2max workout during the week days, but seems like is bit of divide on doing VO2max workouts all year. I decided against that for now for the following reasons: 1) VO2max gains from VO2max intervals should be done closer to focus event and 2) these gains are not VO2max gains that would stick with you for a long time unlike VO2max gain you would obtain from LSD or FTP workout. I will race here and there this year, but I will be racing for the purpose of gaining experience/race-craft and would like to dedicate my training time for building solid aerobic fitness.

When the gun went off I got in the pedals pretty quick but when we hit that first corner, I got stuck behind someone taking it very conservative which was enough to let the group get away(I'd say 6-8 bike lengths) and they were hauling(They averaged about 21-22 mph over the course). I then spent the next 1-2 laps trying to catch them with no luck. Last night I compared my numbers vs those that managed to stay in the group and I had a higher average power and normalized power but a slower mph(18-19). Looking at the overall picture, did I really just miss my goal because of poor positioning in that first corner and then not having anyone to work with to get back to the pack?",1

Missed out so much sweet spot work, I'm really hoping I don't drop in ftp considering I haven't been doing SS work as I'm unable to hit those incorrect numbers. I thought I was not getting enough hours for the week, or not eating right etc.

 - BA to London + AA connection to final destination (in USA)

2. with the first option I need to connect in USA before getting to my final destination. This means picking up my baggage and going through customs. I was thinking of using a cardboard box: maybe I should avoid carrying it around and thus choose the BA+AA flight option? 

I've researched a bit on orucase but I'm not so experienced at taking apart my bike, plus it's expensive and I'm not a frequent flyer and there's still a chance I'd be charged.

520,"Pan flat 4/5 road race without many turns, what to expect? Hey folks,

I'm signed up for Ronde Van Mullica on Sunday and I'm not quite sure what to expect. It's a 40 mile race, 3 laps of triangular circuit with something like 10 ft/mile of elevation gain. Only 3 corners in the entire 13 mile lap, although one of them looks pretty tight. Winds will likely be a major factor, I'll have to pay attention to that.

I've done plenty of crits and one circuit race and I have kind of an idea of what to expect from that style of racing, but I've never done a 'long' race (well, I did a 12 hour race, but that was totally different) or one that didn't really have any climbs or technical turns to break things up. 

Is this thing just going to be 90-100 minutes of a fast group ride, with maybe some attacks launching on the last lap hoping to set up a breakaway? I'm trying to look at Strava from some past years and it seems like it's just as fast as a regular 4/5 crit, despite being triple the distance. I guess that's because there is way less cornering and surges? Should I expect the bunch to just roll along at a steady 24-25 mph? How hot will things be out the gate, do people normally get fully warmed up beforehand and then go crazy, or does it start out kinda mellow and pick up the pace later on? 

Obviously cornering and climbing aren't going to be as much as factors - I'm fairly confident that even if I lose some spots on the tight corner, I can catch back up on the ensuing ~5 mile straight. Normally it's the accordion effect through a bunch of technical turns that puts me in trouble, or climbs. However, I've been sick for a few weeks, so I'm coming in probably with some deterioration of form (although immediately prior to getting sick I hit several sustained power personal-bests) 

I searched and couldn't find any mention of this specific race on prior years Weekly Race Reports, so I thought I would ask for some general advice on this kind of racing as it's significantly different from the normal crits and stuff. Off the top of my head, the biggest one I can think of is that knowing wind direction will be even more important than normal. ",1

548,"Coaching Return - Diminishing Returns/ROI Before May 2018, I was a recreational biker for a year prior - before that time period, it was 20yrs since I had even been on 2 wheels (think BMX as a teen).  I logged 1500 miles in that year (May 2017-May 2018) and my longest ride was 30mi.  Typically, Id ride 1-3 times per week, between 15-30mi each ride.  No structure, just ride - usually hard (20mph avg flat land).

In May of 2018, I decided I wanted to be like you all and try my hand at racing bikes.  Being a former bodybuilder, I was not your ideal bike racer at 200lbs.  Being that I am an all or nothing kinda guy, I hired a coach, bought a $5k bike (w/power meter) and got to work.  In June of 2018, I had an ftp of 240w at 195lbs.  Since then, my ftp has risen to 300w and my weight is down to 175lbs (79kg).  During that time, my coach has been instrumental in building my training plan and teaching me about diet, recovery and racing.  He was a 20yr pro and has a wealth of knowledge.  No doubt I wouldnt be where I am today without him - super valuable!

I have 35 or so races (mix of TT, RR and crits) planned for this season and limited time for actual training because of that race load.  Seems like most of my work will be recovery or endurance rides between races.  Because of what i learned in the past year, I feel I have a good handle on what my off-season training needs to be, how to 'spool up' for race season, how to fix power profile gaps, etc.  I'm a cat 4 now, but would like to be a cat 3 by the end of the year.  Beyond that, I havent really figured out my longer term goals.

556,"Line selection, bunch position and exit speed I originally started writing this as a reply to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/b4v0pp/positioning_cornering_descending_and_combining/), but ended up writing way too much and going into a lot more than what was asked so I thought that I'd make this as its own post. 

The first thing that needs to be perfectly understood to corner well is completely separate to bunch positioning or line selection. Learn this by riding in a much lower pressure format than a race, but still at speed, because high-speed handling can only be learned at speed. You need to get a perfect understanding of your equipment. It should be like having an extra sense similar to proprioception, but feeling these things through your bike. 

When I started riding, I didn't understand what people meant when they described how some bikes felt like you sat up on top, while others feel more like an extension of yourself. Once your fit is dialled, you have your weight pushing through both tyres to maximise traction through a tight, fast corner that would have you skidding out if you shifted your body forward or back mid-turn. This will become intuitive and you'll eventually know how much pressure to put through the outside foot, how much to lean in and how to position yourself on the saddle. 

The next priority is to get a feel for your pedal clearance, because if you can start pedalling a fraction of a second earlier, you'll avoid the huge surge of power required to accelerate as you come out of the corner. Being able to take that extra pedal stroke can save you so much energy when the pace is really high, so you need to be able to feel the difference between barely clearing the pavement and catastrophic pedal clip. This is something which can only be learned through repetition and pushing the limits as far as you safely can to know where the limit is. I've never crashed from a clipped pedal, but all of my pedals have been shaved back little by little when I've been just the wrong side of that limit. You should feel the distance between you pedal and the ground the same way as you feel how extended your leg is. 

The last thing to understand is the traction limit of your tyres. You need to be able to feel the limit of your grip, because there is such a fine line between perfectly railing a corner at speed and losing traction/washing out. Last year after putting a big hole in my rear tyre, I went home and threw on a spare that I had already. I was replacing a GP4000 with a GP4000 and it was pumped to around the same pressure as I usually run. I rode out to race the afternoon crit and was feeling good. As soon as the pace really picked up, I started feeling less confident through the turns as the tyre felt like it was going to wash out more easily than I was used to. My teammate assured me that I didn't have a flat, so I just kept racing, but cornered more timidly than usual. When I looked at it after the race, I noticed that I'd replaced a 25c with a 23c, which is something I hadn't ridden in a long time, so I wasn't used to the different cornering feel. 

That covers the equipment side, so onto line selection. Again, you need to understand this outside of racing before you add all of the other mess back in. You need to know the fastest line through a turn, when taken solo. You need to be able to come in from the outside at speed, graze the apex, then swing back out carrying your speed, ready to start pedalling as soon as you know your pedal will clear the road. In a race you rarely get to take that perfect line and often you won't want to. You need to know the perfect line, before you can learn how to pick which wrong line will be best and why. 

Shallower entry: This will make you stop pedalling sooner and start later at the exit. You will come out of the corner wider and slower, but you take the shortest line, so you will not lose any ground to the riders around you. This keeps you glued to the wheel ahead of you, but requires more of a power surge to reaccelerate out of the turn. I have a time triallist power curve and suffer from repeated sprint efforts, so I avoid this at all costs. This technique is often favoured by sprinters.

Perfect line to apex: You really only get to do this when you're solo or on the front. This is great because you come out at a good speed, having still taken a short line through the corner and it's almost impossible for a rider to pass you in the turn. If you get it right, then you maximise the slinky effect as riders behind you pick their own lines opening small gaps to be closed with little sprints. The back of a big bunch is a very bad place to be when the front rider knows how to do this line at speed. If you're at the back, you often won't have this option as you'll have to choose between braking into the corner or taking a different line to avoid riding into the wheel in front of you. Taking this line is also not always the easiest way to hold a wheel if the rider in front of you takes the tight line, they'll pull away from you a little, which can get you dropped even though their exit speed will be a little lower.

Wider entry: You already know that a tighter corner slows you down more than a sweeper, so you can use that in your line selection. If you go wide, you ride a longer line through the corner, but at higher speed. This means that you drop back from the rider ahead of you, but come out of the corner with more speed. The wider you are, the longer you can pedal. Higher exit speed means that you can pedal back into the draft, while the rider in front leaps out of the saddle to catch the wheel ahead of him. This minimises sprints and is definitely my favourite. 

Onto bunch positioning now. For this, I'll just focus on how tightly to hold the wheel in front of you into a corner.

Glued to their rear tyre on entry: You get the best draft here and will have no gap to shut as you exit. If the rider in front of you brakes, then so do you (always a bit more than they did). You are also restricted to taking a line much closer to theirs. If you go tighter then you swing out into them at the exit. If you go wider it's just as bad because you come out faster and don't have room to ride into, meaning you have to brake as you exit. If they corner tighter than you, but not carrying their speed, they could even wipe out your front wheel (overlap with their rear) as they swing wide on exit. If the rider ahead surges then you need to surge, because you won't ever be coming with more speed. This can work well towards the front, but if you're further back, this technique will maximise your suffering from the slinky effect.

Giving a gap before entry: This will allow a lot more freedom of line selection. If you back off from a way out, you can then run into the draft to hit the turn at high speed and use that to take the tight line to overtake them. Divebomb at your own risk, but it is sometimes the only way to move up past a rider who's taking shit lines. Building speed more subtly than before can allow you to hit the turn faster without overtaking. With this added speed, you can swing wider than the rider ahead to continue building exit speed, but this way you don't give them a gap because you were coming up behind at speed. This gives you the best chance of effortlessly holding the wheel even as they sprint out off the saddle in front of you. The obvious downside is that you will often have a gap ahead of you to shut, but the exit speed usually makes it worth it. The other major risk is having someone try to jump into the gap that you open, which will be more restrictive even than if you'd stayed glued to the rider in front, but now you also lose all your entry speed too.

For reference, my entry into road racing was similar to what the OP in the other post describes. I started off in C grade and after the first few races, I started getting enough top 3 finishes that I was bumped up to B grade after a couple of months.

557,"Power Meter + BB Confusion Looking to get a new power meter, and have been thinking about the power2max NGeco after reading so many good things, but I'm confused about compatibility with my current bike and would like some help deciding on options.

First, my bike currently is running Ultegra 6800 throughout, with a PF30 to BSA adapter in the frame that has a SM-BBR60 in it (I assume this is 24mm internally as I've read that shimano crank spindles are this size?). My current chainrings are compact, but I've been toying with the idea of going mid-compact for a while now too.

The two options I'm considering are:

1)  P2M NGeco Rotor 3D24 with the matching cranks, while keeping my current ultegra rings and fitting this whole setup into the BBR60 that is currently installed.

2) Getting a different NGeco config (not sure which) in 110BCD with new cranks and new rings (mid-compact), but still fitting this into the BBR60 I have installed to keep the price down.

Are both of these feasible? Opinions on how I should move forward or what to choose? I'm kind of lost in my own head/research at this point...",1

I will keep this short, just wanted to see if anyone knows anything about the type of feelings I have in my knee.

I figured with a month free trial without even the need for a credit card, and because I do most of my training on the road so exact intervals are often difficult to hit in terms of power/duration, the idea of HIE and MPA and a way to train just using those metrics seems to make sense with slightly less structure. Also looking back at my rides over the last few months, the software seems pretty accurate in terms of predicting/modeling when my failure points lead to fitness breakthroughs. IE with number of FTP tests over the last 6 months with 20 min and ramp tests both fit well into how my threshold power has dipped and come back up as I progress in base. 

Curious if others are using it and how they best implement the training ie do you follow the recommended training activities or follow another plan and just use XERT for analysis etc",1

569,"Let's overanalyze! So, long story short, I have the same draft-legal triathlon ""A"" race every year. I peaked in 2014, quit the sport in 2015, and have been slowly climbing my way back. I have some good training going on (albeit all in doors for the past 9 months not by choice) but I looked at some numbers from 2017, 2018, and 2019. I looked at training peaks and found the power peaks for my past two races ('17,'18) and compared them. I took the percent difference in required watts for 5 seconds all the way up to 60 minutes and took the average to see (unweighted) how much harder my 2018 race effort was than my 2017.  I came up with an average of 24.1% watts more across those metrics (the 60 minute normalized power was 270 vs 198 so 26.7% so just about same same). I was in a smaller pack and we were running away last year so that checks out as far as why the effort was more difficult. 

Next, I compared the peak efforts for 5 sec, 1,5,10,20,60 minute in my training seasons in 2018 and 2017 and found that the difference was only 1.7% better in 2018 than 2017. Essentially, I was trying to do a quarter more work only have a penny more in the legs. This explains why I couldn't run for shit and missed my podium goal (was in shape to run sub 36:00-37:00 10k, actually ran a 41).

Next, I looked at the training differential between 2018 and 2019 (so far, keeping in mind I haven't even finished my final base phase and have two build phases left) and compared peak performances in training across the same 5 intervals. Right now, it shows a -9% differential (i.e. I'm not putting out peak numbers during base season, which I'm fine with). Honestly, a lot less than what I was anticipating and I'm pretty happy with it.

Finally, and probably least helpful, I compared this years peak numbers to last year's race performance (requirements). According to that, I am only 1.7% behind last year's race requirements and my 1:00 and 5:00 are 6% and 0.9% ahead of schedule respectively. 

My questions now are:
1. Do I need to weight these based on duration? How would I do that?
2. Am I missing any metrics that could be useful?
3. Thoughts on using my race requirement watts for their respective intervals in training instead of ftp? I.e. use my required 5:00 watts from last year for 5:00 intervals in training instead of basing it off my ftp (which is currently a little lower than last year).

570,"positioning, cornering, descending, and combining all 3. sup y'all

&amp;#x200B;

I knew this day would come.  I made it to cat 1 mostly by dumping watts everywhere - I think I did maybe 5 total crits in the last 2.5 years.  however, now I find that at the upper levels of the sport where I obviously can't just out-watt everyone that my weaknesses in pack positioning, descending in a group, and cornering in a group are starting to hurt me. 

&amp;#x200B;

for example, last week at Redlands on the sunset loop I lost wheels on nearly every turn until I was nearly off the back and exposed to the wind, sprinting to catch up after every turn and putting myself in the red before the punches really even started being thrown - didn't take long for me to get dropped.  I find myself letting a 2-3 length gap open before nearly every turn or on any descent and it seems that any time i'm in the peloton I lose 5 wheels through every corner by picking a bad line.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard its best to take the outside line in corners so you don't have to brake as much.  any truth to this?  how about another one - to brake well before any turn so that you can coast straight through?

572,"Training through Ramadan? A question for everyone here: I've gotten into training seriously this year, fairly new cyclist. I'm in Canada, had my road bike since October 2017, and I got an indoor trainer this February. Did a lot of consistent training, 5-6 days a week for about 2 months and I focused primarily on muscular endurance and repeatability for short and sharp efforts, which I must admit was a bad decision. I've put 1700 km on the bike, of which 660 were this year since taking training seriously. I've lost the fitness I've built up every year due to winter and also being away for the summer for 6-7 weeks due to Cadet camps and courses.


I'm 18, 5'7"" and 125 lbs, averaging around 22 km/h solo for most rides. I've started focusing on developing the aerobic engine now with long, steady state rides so hopefully I can get faster. Aiming to cruise around 27-30 km/h, and hopefully start racing sometime.


Now, my main question is what can I do to maintain/build fitness during Ramadan? It's a month long period, May 6th- June 5th this year, where Muslims can't eat or drink anything (including water) from Sunrise to sunset. I do have an indoor trainer so I'll be putting that to good use. What should I be focusing on during that time? And also what would be a good time to ride? While fasted, or before sunrise around 2-3 am? It will be peak riding season so it sucks that I'll have to miss the great weather outside, but it is what it is. I'm guessing fasted riding should have it's own benefits too?

580,"Thoughts on how to best implement structured training into my schedule Hey y'all! I've been training and getting ready to start racing for the last few months, but mostly doing volume as I can, and pretty much just riding hard every time I go out. I am generally able to ride 3 days a week, with 2 days being commutes to and from work, and then a longer ride on the weekends, often with a group. Depending on the day and how much time I have, I have either 12, 15, or 20 mile routes, with a few hundred foot elevation loss on the way to work in the morning and a few hundred foot elevation gain on the way home. I have showers at work, so I'm able to ride hard and not worry about getting sweaty riding in or anything.

So here's the question- I just ordered a power meter (couldn't say no to a 4iiii ultegra 6800 left crank meter for $325), and want to start doing more structured training rides during the week (weekends being group rides and having the time to ride longer, won't be so much interval stuff). With 2 rides per day Mon and Wed, how should I implement intervals? Should I do them in the morning on the way to work, or would I be better off doing them on the way home? On the way TO work, I'll be ""fresh"" off of a rest day, but its early morning so I tend to take longer to warm up and get the engine running, and then I'll have to deal with the ride home 9-10 hours later. On the way home, I'm more warmed up and can get going quicker, but I'll have had the ride in only 9-10 hours earlier and I'll have a day of work behind me, leading to potentially some tiredness, particularly mentally.

Anyone got advice/thoughts on how I should structure this? If it matters, I'm a natural climber and come from a running background (high aerobic capacity, somewhat low max power and muscular strength) and this is my first attempt at really getting into more competitive cycling, though I've always done some cycling on the side.

I have a week of rest at 60% TSS and then I start the “Build Phase”. I’m new to racing and training with a power meter so I’m really only doing ITT’s and Fondos this year. Maybe a few crits, but they won’t be my priority. Basic goal for the year is keep building FTP and perform well in the time trials. 

For my Base period I’ve been ramping 4-6 CTL per week (except rest weeks) using mostly progressively longer sweet spot sessions, and zone 2. This last week has been my highest TSS of 650. I have not done any training outside, just Zwift (sub 2hr workouts) and I maxed out at 11 hrs per week. I do have more time to train, but I just can’t take the boredom inside. So far the FTP gains have been great, but I’m worried about my long distance endurance. 

In the next few weeks I will finally be able to do outdoor long rides. If my goal is to be ready for fondos (150+km) and ITT’s (35-75km), and I want to keep improving endurance for longer rides but also keep making FTP gains, how should I approach the build phase?

I was thinking of doing 2 FTP sessions, 1 sweet spot (3x20 SST + Z2), 1 long and slow (3-6 hrs Z2), and 2 rest days. I set my CTL target at 75 for my first fondo at the end of May. 

(Note: all my planned events are basically flat as a pancake)

Not expecting free coaching, just wanted some basic opinions. I love training, self coaching and the process of learning. I come from a powerlifting background and it’s crazy to see how similar the periodization of the training is.

Sorry if I left any basic info out! ",1

614,"Skipping the easy days during some weeks Hey all. I'm a newbie to cycling, and I've only been doing structured training since December, so this might be a dumb question, but whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm trying to do around 4-5 rides and 6 hours per week. However, due to life, school and other stuff, I'm sometimes only able to ride 2 or 3 times per week. I try to do 2 interval sessions per week, and then keep the rest of the rides easy. Naturally, when I only have the chance to ride 2-3 times a week, I do the interval sessions, and then the easy rides if I get the time. But how much am I missing out by skipping the easy z2 rides in some weeks? I'm guessing most of the benefit, at least to my FTP and 20min power, comes from the interval sessions, so I'm not missing out on too much. But then again, I might be completely wrong, which is why I'm asking the old and wise here :P

618,"Understanding W/Kg and Racing I am hoping to get some insight to W/Kg values in context to racers, types of races, and racing styles. I feel like the old Coggan chart is outdated and really has no context behind the types of racing and how W/Kg demands vary between different types of races. As a new cat 5 racer (primarily crits and some RRs) I was really skeptical as to the power numbers I would need to hold on to the pack and feel like having some of this information in context would have helped me decide to start racing sooner. On top of that I feel like it would help new racers develop a understanding of how to race with/build their power e.g. my 1 and 5 min power are below average compared to other racers in my category so, I should be more careful surging out of corners and try to maintain steady power/speed so I have to surge less. 

So, I was hoping to get some input from everyone on some of your metrics such as:

Raw Power (Max, 1 min, 5 min, 20 min): 1150W, 472W, 376W, 297W 

W/Kg (Max, 1 min, 5 min, 20 min): 12.4 W/Kg, 5.1 W/Kg, 4.0 W/Kg, 3.2 W/Kg

Type of racing you do/Category/Skill level - Cat 5 racing mostly crits and some RRs with no wins and 2 top 10 finishes in 60+ man fields.

I'm well aware of the usual anecdotes, and personal experiences, but I'm interested to find out whether rest weeks could actually partially be a hang-over from earlier training methodologies, and whether they can be omitted/scaled back if you have adequate rest built into each week with carefully managed weekly progressions to maintain a constant slight upward gradient in overload.",1
620,"Tech Talk Thursday - What tires are you running for 2019? I thought it would be nice to talk about tire choices. This is an area that's seen a lot of changes over the past couple years, with the advent of road tubeless, a trend towards much wider rim beds, and lower pressures. In a couple years it seems like we went from everyone running 23mm tires on 15mm internal rims at 120psi to running 25-28mm tires on 17-20mm internal rims at 80-100psi.

As we're getting into early season racing in the Northern Hemisphere, I am assuming that a lot of people will be looking to get new tires, and I thought it might be worthwhile to compile feedback from everyone into one post.

Here are some questions to get you started

* What tires do you run? Are they tubular, clincher (butyl or latex tubes), or tubeless?

* What size and pressure? Is it different front to back?

* What rims do you have them on? What's the actual width of the tire once installed and inflated?

* Do you use exclusive race-day tires, or do you race on the same tires you use for training / group rides? 

* What do you / don't you like about them? Comfort, rolling resistance, puncture protection, grip, treadwear, ease of installing/removing? ",1

622,"Strange cramp-like problem I'm not looking for medical advise per se, but wondering if someone else might have experienced a similar problem and can point me in the right direction.

For about two years now, I've been experiencing this strange sort of cramping. If I had to point to a first time it happened, it was during a triathlon coming out of the swim. I started getting a tightness in my (I think left) quad that started to get progressively worse in transition. I figured I'd get on the bike and try to work it out there, but it quickly turned into a full-on debilitating cramp. I had to stop almost immediately just a few hundred metres out, and almost blacked out on the side of the road. For what it's worth, I had crashed on the bike about a week previous coming back from a rainy group ride. I slid out going over some railroad tracks at a relatively high speed and landed on my right side. I didn't really have any bad symptoms immediately after, not even road rash as it was fresh asphalt and wet from rain.

Subsequent to that incident, the cramps in my legs were unbearable. Spreading from muscle to muscle, to my right leg and into my calves. I tried stretching them and massaging them to try to get the cramp to release and it would, mostly, but there was always tightness that remained and felt like a trigger that could go off again at the slightest stimulation. ART-type stretching of the muscle seemed to actually make it worse. I spent about three weeks off the bike before I was able to ride without the cramps returning.

I've since had this happen multiple times over the last two years. It can be several weeks to several months between episodes.

* I can reliably tell that is going to happen before it happens. It feels like the muscle is primed to cramp before I do anything at all. I'm not sure how else to describe it. It is a subtle feeling distinct enough to register, but never seems notable enough to act on. 
* It starts within seconds of getting on the bike. I think the range of the pedaling motion is what seems to set it off.
* It starts as what feels like a small nodule that then spreads to the rest of the muscle if stimulated. Stimulation could be pedaling, could be stretching, could be massage, could be walking even.
* If I try to work through it, it quickly progresses to a very severe cramp in the entire muscle. This happens with walking too, but to a lesser degree.
* The weird primed state lasts a long time, but I can't say exactly how long. It spreads into different muscles and the other leg, but it's always in the legs. It seems to be on the order of days. Letting it get to the point of severe cramping seems to extend this, maybe due to muscle damage?
* It doesn't start with any particular muscle, but it always seems to be in the thighs to start. It will spread to the calves as well, but never seems to start there.
* Reliably seems to take about 2-3 weeks before I can safely get back on my bike with no symptoms.
* It's not 100% reliable as a predictor, but it often seems to occur after being off the bike longer than normal, but still during an intensive block of riding/training.

Most recent incident I noticed the weird feeling in my glute over the weekend while visiting family. Got on the trainer Monday night and immediately noticed a tight nodule in my left glute that started to spread out. I stopped. Next day I was experiencing cramping at work through my full left leg, but mostly my left calf. I was on my feet more than normal, but not doing anything too extreme. Yesterday felt better with just some residual tightness in my left calf that I tried to lightly stretch at various points throughout the day without great success. Tried hopping on the trainer later in the evening to see if I could manage a light spin (30-50% FTP) and immediately felt the glute seizing up again, so stopped right away. I got maybe 100m down the road on Zwift. Right glute now has that primed feeling, but hasn't cramped or anything yet.

I've tried stretching, I've tried not stretching, I've tried doing exercises to address muscle imbalances (my right leg is noticeably weaker than my left, and there are other more subtle imbalances too), I've tried dietary solutions (bananas). I've seen doctors, a physiotherapist and a chiropractor.

To be clear, this is very different from normal exercise-induced cramping. I've had normal cramping happen in the past and since having these episodes, and recovery is always very quick and those cramps respond well to stretching and always follow prolonged exercise.

I'm wondering if anyone else out there has experienced similar sorts of symptoms and has any insights they can offer me. There seems to be very little known about what causes cramping, and this particular type seems quite different from what most people experience.

I'm pretty sure it's not related to diet. It might be related to muscle imbalances, but it seems weird how it seems to spread between muscles and affect both legs. It might be related to some sort of muscle damage, possible from when I crashed, but it doesn't start in the same place every time. A friend recently wondered if it might be due to some sort of nerve impingement, and that intrigues me as it might explain the weird primed feeling I get beforehand.",1
623,"Interval tips wanted I wanted to up my game over the winter and bought a trainer. No coach, training plan etc yet but I have been on it at least four times a week for an hour each time. I have been using the following [GCN interval workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTs2fwpqBbg) for most of these sessions. It is six intervals of 30 sec 180% FTP, 3min FTP, 10 sec 120% FTP followed by a four minute rest. Is this a good all around interval session? Are there better ones on youtube?",1
624,"Combine high and low intensity in one training session? Someone at r/bicycling suggested this is the reddit where I can expect more/better feedback re this question:  


What would be the effect of (after warming up decently) doing high intensity (e.g. hiit style bike intervals for about 10-15 minutes or a set of somewhat longer zone 4 intervals) followed by low intensity steady state (e.g. 2-3 hours of zone 2) within one training session?

I've been reading the discussions about LISS training vs high intensity, tend to agree with the idea that it's good to have both in all periods of training. Of course, how much of each differs based on the period, the athlete, the time available, etc. All of what I've read seems to assume, though, that within each training session, you do either one or the other. Is combining the two detrimental to the training effects, or does it increase the risk of making the training stress too high? Or wil you get both effects to an acceptable degree?

If it does work, it could be particularly interesting for those weeks where you can fit in too few training sessions to do everything separately. Not suggesting to incorporate high intensity in all rides..",1

631,"Winter Training - Trouble with consistent gains I am training this winter for my first year trying to become respectable (keep up with intermediates) on a road bike, to do this I have been on the spin bike 2-3 times a week regularly doing the following workout: 

5 minute warm up @80rpm ~110w
30 second intervals @100 and @90rpm between 350w and 220w for 20 minutes
5 minute cool down @80rpm ~110w

I was able to do this quite comfortably and I was steadily increasing my wattage and interval times over the past two months. However, the past 3 weeks I have been struggling to manage what I was easily able to do. I’m now struggling to keep up with my intervals and quickly lose the pace within 5-7 minutes of starting my 30/30 and I have to tone it down. 

Could this be as a result of overtraining? I haven’t changed my diet or regular training schedule? What can I do to keep progressing and improving my cycling? I wish I could get TR or zwift but currently I can’t set up any system until likely next winter.

Due to this winter's awful weather I rode the trainer more than ever before, with much less (fat and road) riding outdoors. Overall, I think that (most) of my fitness is better for it.

However, these issues are making me wonder if the static nature of riding on the trainer supports, or almost promotes, poor form? While I'm not jerking the trainer around or any of those things, I do think that the static upright position --- lack of side to side motion of the bike --- is causing me to rock my body a little.

633,"Intervals - What did I just do... I am a roadie that tends to respond very well to VO2 max intervals, but I am trying to vary them up a little bit so I don't become too one dimensional.

I have been doing around 3.5 minutes on 3.5 minutes off at about 120% FTP and have been getting good benefits, but wanted to work a little more on sustained power, perhaps push up the amount of time I can work just above threshold rather than massively above threshold, but since I know I respond well to VO2 max efforts, I wanted to use that.

What I came up with on the fly today, and then tried, was 3 minutes on @ about 112-115%, 1 minute off, repeat 5 times. By the end it felt similar to the perceived exertion of 3.5 minutes on/off @ 120%, repeat 4 times. It feels like it would work my sustained power harder since there is less time to recover and all the energy systems have to stay engaged for the entire 20 minutes total effort.

But upon sitting down and doing some research, a workout like this doesn't appear to exist particularly in the 'established methodology'.

649,"Enve Says No ""Open Tubular"" Clinchers on Their Wheelsets Dear Loyal ENVE Customer, Thank you for riding ENVE. We hope that you are thoroughly enjoying your ENVE SES wheelset(s). 

Based on reports from the field that tires with cotton, silk, or other natural fiber sidewalls with open tubular style of construction were degrading quicker than expected, we launched a study to understand the validity and prevalence of these claims. As a result of this investigation, we confirmed that tires using natural sidewall materials with an open tubular type construction, are not fit for use with ENVE carbon rims. It is important to note that through this study, we reached out to many dealers as well as other wheel manufacturers to see if their consumers are having the same results as ours. The response was an unequivocal confirmation that these tires were fatiguing prematurely and in some cases resulting in crashes and injury to the rider when the tire sidewall failed or the tire came off the rim without warning. 

There are two specific failure modes that have been documented and are not limited to ENVE rims, rather these failures have been consistent in our test lab on a variety of other manufacture’s rims, both alloy and carbon. 

The first failure is best defined as a cut or wearing through of the natural fibers on the sidewall of the tire at or near the rim’s hook bead. Once cut through, the tube extrudes through the tear and bursts, often unseating the tire from the rim resulting in sudden loss of control and a crash. The cutting of the sidewall is the result of soft fibers (the cotton or similar textile) being abraded by the harder edge of the rim during the rotational compression cycles of wheel and tire. 

The second failure mode is that of the tire itself stretching off the rim. This is can be caused by a variety of factors, among them, low bead stiffness, varying tire diameters, over inflation, or some combo of the three. The tires most susceptible to this failure are those with a “handmade open tubular” type construction. Given the large selection of tires on the market that deliver excellent performance with reliability, it is our recommendation that ENVE customers should not pair these tires with their ENVE wheelsets.

&amp;#x200B;

HERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC BRAND/TIRE MODELS THAT WE DO NOT RECOMMEND:

&amp;#x200B;

**Vittoria Corsa Non-Tubeless (Not ALL Vittoria Tires)** – This tire features cotton sidewalls in black, para (tan), and anthracite (gray). This tire has been described to us by Vittoria as a race day only type of tire and that it is not recommended for training or prolonged use. This tire has been the main offender for cut sidewalls. While this one tire is not recommended for use with ENVE wheels, Vittoria’s Rubino model tires and the tubeless ready Corsa Speed have proven safe and reliable in our testing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Challenge Handmade Clinchers – These are Open Tubular Non-Vulcanized Tires***Models:  Criterium SC S, Strada SC S, Paris Roubaix SC S, Strada PRO, Paris Roubaix PRO, Elite PRO*

650,"S-Works 7 - Fit Advice Ok so I know there are a ton of specialized haters here so apologies in advanced for giving my money to the incarnate of ~~Satan~~ Sagan himself. 

With that out of the way - recently upgraded to the latest S Works 7s from the Torch 2.0s and have been having a lot of inside foot numbness (big toe, right under ball and right above ball as well as most of the inner line). I know these shoes have been pretty popular in the peloton but I’m wondering if any of y’all have had similar issues with these shoes or others and whether or not this is a cleat fit issue or just the wrong shoe for me. 

Few considerations:
- I went down a size since my torches were def a little too big (44 from a 45) and while i have room in the toe box, they are a little tight on the edges. 
- I translated my cleats exactly from the torches including wedges and an insert 
- I have high arches so I’m using the spez blue inserts just like I was in the torches. 
- the numbness usually starts after 20 miles and continues even after I loosen. It seems to be especially bad the more power I put down. 
- Consistent power seems to make it worse as opposed to sprints which I usually can recover from pretty quickly. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated - getting close to my 30 days and as much as I don’t want to be that asshole that returns things, $400 is a lot for numb toes. ",1

I just listened to a Youtube video by Francis Cade in which his coach, Ken Buckley, talks about the PMC and the Fitness curve.  He says that Fitness is just Chronic Training Load (CTL) is simply average daily TSS.

Edit:  Ken didn't say that CTL is fitness, but that on the PMC the Fitness Curve represents CTL (not what I would commonly think of as fitness)

From his comments, I gathered that increasing load is only effective up to the point that you have a load that matches to the types of events you're training for.

So, if my TSS is around 450 now, I don't think that I need to increase it much, if at all.  But even if it does, how can I determine what it should be?  Where should my TSS level out at?

656,"Picking Wheels for RR &amp; Crits Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

Company recently signed up to a UK cycle to work scheme with £2k limit. I've been pining after some new wheels to replace my older Mavic Cosmics. Main reason for the swap is just how skinny the Mavic rims are, even with 25s on they still balloon out and ruin any potential aero gainz. They also have sticky hubs...

&amp;#x200B;

Primary use will be Northumbrian/Scottish rolling road races (nothing mountainous) often with short steep climbs and a few local crits.

&amp;#x200B;

Current contenders are the following. What do people think of these? Are there any others I should be considering? As always it seems like you read one gleaming review then click another website which trashes them.  


Roval CLX 50 (or) 64

Reynolds Aero 65

657,"Comparison of Vo2Max Intervals Inspired by /u/sparecycles, Dr. Seiler and other's I've been experimenting with polarized training principles and Vo2Max intervals.  Here are my results as they stand so far, still a lot more exploration to do though.

*I've tried a series of different Vo2Max interval styles with the primary goal of accumulating time above 90%Vo2Max.*  

**5x 5Min Intervals**  
[These intervals](https://i.imgur.com/L0vG8XI.png) are prescribed by WKO4's 'Optimized Interval' chart as the best way for me to exercise 'max aerobic' energy system.  These constant power efforts were difficult, but manageable and resulted in *more than 20 minutes TIZ out of 25 minutes of work duration.*

**Kitchen Sink Intervals**  
[This workout](https://i.imgur.com/eUgM4Cw.png) started with a pair of 3 minute hard start intervals which were extremely effective at getting up above 90% Vo2Max quickly, but they were very demanding and I switched mid-workout back to steady power 5 minute intervals (max effort).  Which wound up being about 10w (and a few % Vo2Max) below the previous Vo2Max workout intervals.  Finally I tried a set of 20s:10s tabata intervals which also weren't very effective at accumulating time above 90% Vo2Max.  As a results I accumulated *less than 15 minutes TIZ out of 27 minutes of work duration.*

**3x 8Min Intervals**  
[These sucked really hard.](https://i.imgur.com/J69GUwk.png)  I paced these head down not looking at any numbers other than the clock.  Being such a long Vo2Max interval it was really difficult to pace and resulted in really low TIZ.  *Just 11 minutes TIZ out of 24 minutes of work duration.*  It's worth noting that these actually provided 22 minutes &gt;85% Vo2Max, so I'm sure they were still valuable as a tool of increasing my aerobic work capacity, but they didn't accomplish my goal of TIZ &gt;90% Vo2Max.

**Anerobic Power test plus 8x 3Min Intervals**  
Having two competing goals in [this workout](https://i.imgur.com/asyl1qC.png) was a mistake, I got a really good 2-minute max effort test to help round out my Power Duration curve, but this came at the cost of getting any kind of valuable Vo2 work done.  Perhaps if I rested longer after the max effort I could have salvaged some quality, but as it stood I [died a thousand deaths](https://i.imgur.com/9bCsvhR.png) during each of the 2 intervals I was able to finish before waiving the white flag.

**Questions to answer**  

* Are 5 minute intervals universally better, or just more effective for me (i.e. Does WKO4 predict truly athlete 'optimal' targets).
* Can I quantify incoming fatigue and stress to help normalize results?
* Are there more optimal intervals for a given day based on incoming stress/recovery/etc?

**Take-Aways**  

*  5 minutes seems like a really promising workload for getting a high percentage of time &gt;90% Vo2Max
* Tabata style intervals weren't super effective after a lot of earlier work in the workout.
* 8 Minute intervals are hard to pace and are mentally challenging
* Picking one goal for a demanding workout is probably a good idea.

It got me thinking that a lower gear ratio would be harder because there's less flywheel inertia to ""push"" your legs over the dead spot, so your pedal stroke is less efficient. This also might be why climbing feels harder at the same power as on a flat, at least to me. Evidentally I found it easier to get through higher power intervals in the big ring.

Only to find that when pushing hard the chain would slip on the cassette. Indexing and shifting was bang on but would just slip when putting in a solid high torque effort. 

I was very sad faced while racing as I was just staying in the saddle and taking time to close gaps rather than just a handful of strong pedal strokes. 

Now I have a Sunday afternoon to work out wtf. Only thing I didn’t change was jockey wheels. And used a whipperman quick link vs my normal kmc ones. Though the slip didn’t appear to be related to quick link position on the chain. 

Edit: Changed over to an almost new SRAM 1090 11-25 this morning, ensured using the same process as all time of redoing the limit screws and cable tension to ensure good shifting in the stand; and boom, perfect non-slip high torque on the ride this morning.

667,"Power and Heart Rate Differences between Indoor and Outdoor Riding So I've been riding on my gym's indoor bike this winter, and not having a power meter on my road bike I really like how I always know how hard I am working. I only have a heart rate monitor when training outdoors and was planning on matching the heart rate zones with the power zones as determined on the indoor bike. I was wondering though, what differences there were between the outdoor and indoor bikes in terms of heart rate and power output. 

For those of you with a power meter, do you find you get the same power output indoors compared to outdoors for the same heart rate? For example, if 150 bpm average gives you 220W on the indoor bike, would you expect a higher, or lower, power output at this same heart outside on a road bike? Would 150bpm,say give you closer to 200W or 240W outside? I know wind cooling can have an effect, but there are probably lots of good and bad factors that increase and decrease power. ",1

669,"Update on gnarly climb in Ecuador What's up guys, sorry in advance for the long post. 

A few months ago I posted about the insane Strava segment I found in Ecuador that I wanted to try to take the KOM on while I was studying here. [Here](https://strava.app.link/A5ZrEOMdIU) is the segment, it is about 44miles with 12,400ft of climbing, and it is ranked as the 3rd hardest climb in the world. People asked me to update once I attempted the ride, so that's what this post is for. 

The ride was last Saturday, and long story short, it went probably as bad as it possibly could have gone. The weather was truly terrible, with torrential rain, constant winds, and fog so thick there was only about 50ft of visibility all day. 

To take the KOM, I needed to have a NP of ~207 watts for a little over 5hrs, and I had a Best Bike Split pacing plan that I was following. Legs felt really good, and despite the brutal weather I was on good pace for the first 4hrs of the ride, with a normalized power of like 205w. I was eating the whole ride and felt like I was on top of my nutrition, but at about 4.5hrs, things started to get rough super fast. My power dropped of significantly, and I started to really suffer. By the 5hr mark, I was experiencing the worst bonk/implosion of my life. Ended up having to call the ride off with 10mi left in the climb because I was full on delerious and was blacking out and throwing up. 

All in all, it was a pretty rough day, and even though I had to bail early, I still finished with 10,500ft of climbing over just 33.7mi. My main takeaway from this is that I have a lot to learn about nutrition and pacing for super long efforts like this climb. 

Despite the awful weather and mega-bonk, it was an awesome experience. South America is insane, and if you ever get the chance to ride in the Andes, do everything you can to make it happen.

678,"Get back to fixed gear crit racing Hello everyone !  


**To start my story I'll just say that my goal is to race the red hook crit in about a year time.**  


I started riding my fixed gear bike again about 2 weeks ago and had this lovely feeling of just pedaling and enjoying sports in general. As usual I was talking about red hook criterium, because it has always been a dream to me although I've never thought I would try to train for it and make time. Since there won't be a red hook crit in 2019 I was thinking, why don't I just start training again and go for it in 2020. That being said I bought a second hand race bike two days ago, because only training on a fixie isn't that good if you want some recovery, longer rides...  


I am turning 20 years old at the end of march and I used to sport on a very high level between 11 and 15 years old.   
I quit cycling at the end of summer 2014, because I had to train too much in the team I was in and started hating cycling then. I used to ride my bikes 5-6 days a week  


However I bought a fixed gear bike that I wanted to race with (because it's so much fun). I did a few crits, with the biggest one being radrace Rotterdam, where I finished 42nd of 85 with an average speed of 45 km/h. I trained a little bit on speed and did a few rides before that, but nothing too crazy and had a really great result in my opinion.  


Now that's a long time ago and I have been practicing some sport, but not as much as I used to. **My goal is to ride high pace and intense criteriums again in about a year.**  
I have currently done a few  rides around 50 km at an average of 30 km/h and tried sprinting a few times going up to 55 km/h but being dead after the sprints.  


How should I train ? Should I start with longer rides to get my standard fitness better and then start doing intervals etcetera again. Should I go and see a sports doctor first ? Train more on the road bike for now and then fixie ? Should I train the same program as when I was 15 and very fast ?

713,"Seeking advice: Race strategy for breaking the speed record an a tandem bicycle I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate at the University of Liverpool in the UK. I am part of the university's Arion6 project to build an enclosed slip stream tandem bike capable of breaking the land speed record currently set at 89.59 mph (144.17 kph) (the specific record for tandem cycles is considerably lower at 71mph). The competition consists of a 5-mile run with a speed trap over the last 200m. 

I am seeking advice or any help that could be given regarding race strategy and how to ramp the riders power over the 5-mile stretch. My initial though was to treat it like a bunch sprint with a sprinter and a lead out rider, however this situation doesn't really apply to the nature of our challenge due to drafting not being part of the equation. My engineering side says that the most effective way would be to have both riders ramp up their power so both would be at maximum power output for the final 200m, however I am not a sports scientist so there may be something I have overlooked.
The event that runs most closely to our specifications is the tandem para cycling spring events, however this does not match perfectly and there is little to no information available about rider outputs.

I would appreciate any advice anyone could give.

TLDR: How would a tandem pair reach the fastest possible average speed over 200m at the end of a 5 mile flying start?

718,"Philly Gang - would you show up for an unsanctioned hilly checkpoint 'race' this spring? So I'm in the preliminary stages of planning an event with my club and I wanted to get some feedback from you guys (both the local crew, as well as anyone who has organized similar events in the past). I'm thinking of doing this sometime in April, probably on a Saturday (currently leaning 4/27 as I don't think there is anything major in the area scheduled for that day)

I would set up in a picnic area at a local park, and set up some fairly basic food and drinks. Riders would meet at a set time and be handed a map of the local area with 8-10 checkpoints shown on the map. You would ride to all of the checkpoints in any order you want, and then return to the start. I'd keep the checkpoints within a ~5 mile radius of the starting point, and plan it out to be in the neighborhood of 25-35 miles depending on the exact route you take. No rest stops along the route, but you could come back to the starting point if you wanted to, I'd try to keep it manned and have food/water available. Each checkpoint would have some way to prove you're there. The back of the map would be a checklist and I'd try to do stuff like ""At this intersection, there's a mailbox. What color is it?"" or similar - easy things that you could just write down to prove you made it to the checkpoint. I'd try to keep a decent amount of variety in it to make things interesting, but I wouldn't do anything that really requires stopping for more than a minute or so, or carrying anything back with you on your bike. 

It'd be a sorta-not-really race in that I would probably hand out some cheapo medals or a goofy prize to the first 3 finishers, but it would not be USAC sanctioned. It wouldn't be closed course either - all the roads would be open to traffic and you'd have to follow the rules. Although the area I have in mind for this is pretty woodsy and these would all be 2-lane back roads without many traffic lights or intersections, just the occasional 4-way stop at a major crossroads. From a legal perspective, I'd have it organized as an unguided club ride (which we have existing insurance for), which means you sign a waiver in order to ride. It can't actually be a race, so that's why the prizes are just going to be silly things without any cash value. But, obviously, you're encouraged to go hard on the hills and have a fun time, and not having closed roads shouldn't really impact that.

I'm unsure of how much it would cost, but probably worst case I would charge $20 to cover food and insurance. Hopefully more like $10 though. It would be open to groups or teams or whatever. You're encouraged to work together, but not required to, and there won't be a published route. That should make things spicy, because there are plenty of climbs in the area and you may have to decide between a shorter hilly route or a longer flatter route between checkpoints. The hills are generally 0.5-1 mile at about 5% (the biggest climbs being a bit over 200 ft elevation) - plenty enough to make things exciting, without being so hard that you need to be a serious climber to have fun.

724,"How differently An/aerobic systems working in cycling vs. other endurance sports (running) Please forgive me for my ignorance. 

I started cycling on a wattbike around last year due to my second knee injury from rugby (tore 3/4 ligaments) at around 100watts for an hour as rehab 6 days a week. 
Since then, I’ve started taking cycling quite a bit more seriously. I managed to get my hands on a decent enough road bike for my type of riding and have discovered athleticism from running doesn’t seem to translate? (I’m aware Of the fact that a knee injury severely hinders me, however my knee has actually recuperated to ~100%)

I’ve always had a very strong endurance background, winning several of my districts cross country (running) races from the ages of 13 to 18 and being a decent 100m (11.1s) 400m (51.95s) runner, although I very rarely won 100m and 400m races because those kids were FAST. 
These days (I’m 21) my times aren’t quite the same, however they still seem relatively decent, concluding I’m not terribly unathletic these days.

This has always led me to believe I’m a very decent athlete (not great, but good enough!), until I started cycling. I’m 81kg and have a 20 minute power of 290W- very average (apparently, from what I’ve read). However this is after a beginning 20 min FTP of 215W about 1.5 months ago (Beginning of training with power). 

After checking Strava and seeing the numbers some people are putting out (350W ftp’s at 68kg weights), my mind is blown. I just don’t understand how people with so little muscle mass are able to keep that kind of power up for so long. 
If you could please enlighten me as to how the an/aerobic systems work while cycling(or your entire body in general) differing to running, or other sports.

726,"Hiccup in my annual training plan Fairly new to racing here and looking for some advice from all of you experienced guys and gals. I recently bought The Time Crunched Cyclist book and used it to formulate my annual training plan. Realizing that I can only really do two 11 week build periods I decided to do one starting in mid February, rest fully then start another about 4 weeks out from my A priority race this summer. In the meantime I thought I would do a couple of Zwift FTP building programs (which have been very productive for me in improving my FTP, mostly thanks to having not used structured training in the past). On the last FTP program I made a big mistake and cranked up my FTP setting by about 20 watts. About 3 weeks in I started noticing major signs of over training! I have backed off and am planning to slowly get back into training. My question is what should I do for the next 12 or so weeks before starting the TCC training program? Also what should I be doing next year when I am not on the program? Maybe the answer to my second question is in the book, but I haven't found it.

I usually ride five days a week (8 separate rides) and at the moment I'm mainly doing tempo/SST intervals though last week I did 6x6' (3' rest) @ 5-10 beats below LTHR. The workout before that was 7x5' (3' rest). I'm planning on doing 5x7-8' with similar rest tomorrow. Thanks. :)",1

The idea would be to get orders on structured plans: X watts for Y minutes for Z sessions.

Trainer Road and such-like are indoor-trainer ONLY. I ride 12 or 30 miles most days while commuting, and so the idea that I'm going give it 100% on a machine after commuting and obey its rest day commands doesn't work.

I also hate training inside. I bought a Kinetic Fluid thingy and never use it. I'd rather layer up and head outside barring ice on the roads.

What is the best way to improve as an all round rider after building that base? Work on improving ftp? Vo2? 

Goal is to be better at everything (not best). Better at long group rides, climbing, crits, just a good all rounder. Long term goal is crits.",1
733,"Why are threshold intervals so short? Brief intro. I have been just trying to get more and more watts each time for 1 hour. For the past 6 weeks or so I have been getting 5-8W improvements each week from 202W to 242W today. I imagine this is pretty much all at FTP since I'm really going all out and my heart rate is capped at around 173 here. 

So my question is, if FTP is the power you can sustain for 40-60 minutes, then why do I see threshold intervals workouts being like 6-12 minute intervals with half the period of rest? It doesn't really make sense. I think the whole point of training zones is that you are trying to spend time at a certain lactate concentration and the whole point of threshold rides is that it is just at the tipping point where lactate is about to increase exponentially; so you are spending time at this critical threshold.  

When I do 60 minute at threshold, I feel like it only starts getting hard at 12 minutes in, meaning that if I were to do 8-10 minute intervals, I would be stopping right when the lactate condition that is driving threshold adaptations is achieved; only experiencing the adaptation from sub-threshold work. I would imagine that 30 minutes straight at threshold would be better than something like 5x10' threshold, because with the 10' intervals you just stop right when your body gets two the second lactate threshold, letting lactate clear and then resuming, whereas with the 30 minute session, you are getting at least 20 minutes of work in at that critical concentration.

734,"Best way to increase FTP from 140-200w I should probably start this post off by saying that I'm still a novice to cyling, so some of my questions are probably a bit stupid, but whatever. And the reason I want to focus primarily on my FTP is because I'm 60kg, so I want to be a climber, and riding at high sustained power is basically what you do as a climber, I think... :=)

I currently have an FTP of 140w. It's from a Tacx blue matic trainer with virtual power, so I have no idea if it's accurate or not, but it seems like it is consistent at least. I want to try to raise this to around 200w by the end of June, when the summer holidays start, and I want to know what the best way to do this would ble. I'm currently able to ride 4 times a week, as I play football 2 times a week as well, and I want at least one recovery day as well. 

I'm currently doing around 1-2 interval days each week, where one of the interval sessions are more FTP focused, for example 2x20min at FTP, or 4x10min at or slightly above FTP, and if I do two interval sessions per week, I make the other one a VO2max one with something like 40/20s or 7x3min at 110-120% of FTP. Between these I do longer rides of like 90mins to 3 hours, keeping it steady, although I tend to be pretty tired at the end. when I do those on the trainer, I keep it in z2, in my case around 95-100w, but I prefer doing them outside when the weather allows, and then I just go on feel. 

So my question is if this is a good and effective way to go about increasing my FTP, or should I be doing something different? Should I change one of the endurance rides for Sweetspot instead for example? I only have time for long rides on Friday and the weekends, so during the week I usually do intervals instead. 

My second question is that is a 60w, or around 40%, increase in FTP realistic, or is it too ambitious? I understand that this is individual and difficult to answer, but I suppose it's still possible to tell if it might be achievable, or if I've just completely lost the plot here. I've been riding since last summer, but only done structured training since January. Before that I did around 2000km in 6 months, and although I did do some hill repeat rides and such, it was mostly unstructured riding. So I don't think I'm anywhere near potential and still have a lot of gains to make. Atleast thats the impression I've been getting if experienced riders of my wheight can get their FTP to double of what mine is.

For better or worse, I spent the majority of last summer practicing cornering &amp; descending down winding mountain roads in the Catskills &amp; the various gaps in Vermont; now I'm fairly comfortable with carving as straight &amp; efficient of a line as possible through a curves &amp; corners.

At what point is it more efficient to pick a better line than it is to draft off of someone ahead of you?

 I rode a borrowed bike with 9170. It's on another level. The shifts on the front and rear are super crisp and fast. The auto-trim is very quick and solid. Downshifting the rear with gloves is terrible. Gloveless it was incredible what you could do. The wrist and hand movement of mechanical is what works against it in my opinion, the ease of use with Di2 is what sets it apart. 

I have small hands, and the 9170 hoods were REALLY nice. Very smooth and easy to use, they were the most comfortable thing - my hands fit around them easily so this made just riding feel easier. That isn't at all fair to my DA 9000 group - which will be up for sale soon.

I'm a bit stuck on _what_ I should be training for. My current FTP is 315 W (that's 3.6 W/Kg as a 87 Kg rider). I feel like that's not bad but I'd love to get up to the 4 W/Kg mark if possible.

775,"Thinking about getting into racing Hey guys- I've been a competitive runner in the past (through college and a bit past) and did a decent bit of cycling, but never really got into racing. I started running into more injury problems and basically quit running, and had a pretty nasty crash (concussion and tore every piece of my kit including gloves and socks :-P) and dropped cycling for a while. Anyway, now I'm getting back in the saddle and really enjoying it and feeling the itch to get into more competitive situations again, so I'm thinking about getting into some racing. I've never really done a serious bike race (I've ridden the Tour de Tucson a couple of times, but I understand thats more of a ride than a race in many ways), so I was looking for some advice on equipment and how to get into it. 

I'm currently riding a 2010 vintage Ebay Carbon frame, and I just upgraded to a new Ultegra R8000 groupset, with Oval Concepts R527 wheels. Are there changes that I ought to make to get this race ready, or is this setup pretty good to go? My natural strengths lie in climbing, so I'm mostly looking at either road races or hill climbs if that makes a difference in where you guys would go with the equipment. The idea of Crits just scares me, plus I'm really skinny, so generating the power to sprint out of corners sounds like I'd just get trashed.

Any advice for getting into a first race? I've ridden in groups and the couple of tours, but are there things its important to think about or do that might be different in a race? I guess part of my worry is that as the pace goes up in groups, chances of a crash go up too, and I'd like to do everything I can do to avoid that again (obviously there is always a chance, I'd just like to minimize). I just don't want to completely get in over my head. Getting into bike racing is a little daunting compared to lacing up my shoes and showing up to run a race :-P Thanks in advance!

776,"Does cadence drop as one ages? I am training again after about 10 years off. Things are going about alright but there is something odd that I noticed.

My ""natural"" cadence is much lower than it used to be.

Late 20s: @ FTP (~300-330W), I used to ""spin"" 100-105 rpm.
Almost 40: @ FTP (~270-275W), I ""mash"" 80-85 rpm

(And it's true for all effort levels: e.g. sweet spot rpm used to be 90-95 and is now 70-75.)

Is that normal/typical for aging riders to have lower cadences?

Does cardio fitness degrades faster than leg strength as we age? (Higher rpm requires less force per pedal stroke but puts more demands on heart.)

779,"New to training - Maximal output only lasts a few seconds? + few more questions. I'm pretty new to road cycling and super new to training, recently got an indoor trainer off Amazon, yesterday (AccelaVelo Fluid, really happy with it so far). No heart rate monitor or power meter yet. Still need to get clipless pedals + shoes, need to decide if I should get those or an HRM first.


My question is mainly regarding maximal efforts. I'm a 125 lbs, 5'8"" 18 year old male. I only started running about 2-3 years ago through Couch to 5K, and completed that program. Discovered road cycling and fell in love. I haven't gotten any background in endurance sports previously, or any sports for that matter. I lived a largely sedentary lifestyle.


I've noticed that I can only maintain a out-of-saddle effort pushing hard for a couple seconds, maybe 15-20 at the most. After that my legs start to burn and it becomes almost impossible to push past the lactic acid. Same thing with a sprint, I'm following GCN's indoor training videos and they had a 20-second maximal sprint in the back half, I kicked as hard as I could and only maintained it for 10 ish seconds, fading towards the end with almost seized legs.


One anomaly I have is last year around September ish, I had a lot of time and I actually managed about 200km in one week. Now my total mileage since I got my road bike in October 2017 is around 1400 km so not high, mainly haven't had time. So during that week, I still distinctly remember a ride I did where I was feeling good cruising around, and then I decided to do a Sprint effort. After that sprint effort, something happened and I was able to somehow sustain a high power up climbs and normally as well, like right after the effort. I spun up a pretty steep climb in my 50t big ring and like a 25t or 23t at the back and I felt good.


What would have happened there that allowed me to sustain higher power outputs right after that?

And what can I do to get stronger and faster? I average 23 km/h solo when I ride for about 2 weeks regularly, but when I don't have time I drop back down to 21ish after not riding. I'd like to get up to 25 km/h and higher (I had one ride in the same week I mentioned where I maintained 25 km/h for an entire hour, best I've done. No tailwind or headwind, I maintained my speed both ways. )

I did a GCN aerobic cadence workout yesterday on the trainer and did a endurance session today with 3x 1-minute efforts watching a movie on the trainer.

I have been following TrainerRoad's Sustained Power Build plan, and I have been super happy with my growing fitness. A ramp test here in Cuence, Ecuador at 8,500ft last week gave me an FTP of 255, which translates to roughly 290-300 at sea level, which is a personal best for me (currently just below 170lbs).

My question is regarding my taper before this big ride. I am planning to go for it on February 24th (exactly 3 weeks from today), and I want to put myself in the best position I can to drop the fastest time I can do. Any advice or ideas about what my taper should be/when to start would be much appreciated. I understand that the final week of a TR plan is supposed to be a taper week. Will this be sufficient? From some research online, it seems that people recommend around a two week taper before a big event, where you reduce volume, but maintain some intensity and roughly the same frequency of workouts. Thoughts? The entirety of my attempt at the climb will be tempo work between 75-90% of my threshold at 8,500ft, so I am a little confused on if I should continue to focus on some higher intensity work in the coming weeks.

Any insight or advice will be hugely appreciated! I look forward to some thoughts from people with a lot more knowledge on this stuff than I have.

796,"r/Velo Bike Tech Series #2: ""Hubs - How Do They Even?!?!"" [Part 1: Shifter/Derailleur Compatibility was posted last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/84z9p9/a_brief_history_of_shimano_compatibility/)

Hubs are (obviously) the part in the middle of the wheel that holds them together. There are a couple things going on here. All hubs consist of an outer shell that rotates. Inside, there is a pair of bearings that ride along an axle which connects to the frame. We've got three kinds of attachments - bolt-on axles, quick releases, and thru-axles. Let's start off with the simplest configuration, a bolt-on axle with cup and cone bearings. The axle is basically a threaded rod that goes through a hollow hub shell. The hub shell has bearing races on it (called cups) and the axle has bearing races on it (called cones). The bearings are in angular contact, which allows it them to react both vertical loads (your weight on the bike) and lateral loads (cornering). The cones are threaded onto the axle and by adjusting the distance between them, you can properly pre-load the bearings. Just outside of the cones are locknuts, which are basically jam nuts that you tighten against the cones to keep them from moving. The distance between the locknuts is called the Outside Locknut Distance (or OLD), and when people talk about a xxx millimeter hub, that's what they are referring to - the axle itself protrudes from either side. This fits into C-shaped dropouts on the frame or fork, and then an additional bolt is threaded onto the axle to clamp it all together. Note that the outer nuts are not affecting our bearing preloads at all - the locknuts are doing that. The outer nuts are holding the axle against the frame. And remember, the axle does not rotate, the hub shell rotates around the axle. 

[Pic 1: Bolt-On Axle](https://imgur.com/eaznZvw.jpg)

Now, the next variation is what we'll see most commonly on road bikes. In this, the axle is hollow. It's still threaded and our cones and locknuts all work exactly the same way. However, our two outer nuts are replaced by a long thin rod called a skewer, connecting an acorn nut and a quick release lever. This assembly allows you to clamp the axle from both directions just by turning the lever. What's important to note here is that the skewer rod and the axle are both stationary. A lot of people refer to the skewer as the axle, but it's not - it goes inside the axle, and really the only purpose it serves is to be able to clamp the dropouts against the axle. There's also a gap - the rod is thinner than the hollow axle.

[Pic 2: Quick Release](https://imgur.com/IBBWCio)

Finally, the last variation is what you'll see on most modern disc brake bikes, called the thru axle. This replaces our C-shaped dropouts with holes. On one side, the hole is either threaded into the frame or has a replaceable threaded insert. The thru axle (note that we still have our axle that the bearings are running on, the 'thru-axle' itself is really just a beefier skewer. There's no rotation against the surface of the thru-axle.) is screwed in from one side. Some may have a quick-release style cam mechanism to get the right tension, others may just screw in to a specified torque. This setup provides more rigidity.

[Pic 3: Thru Axles](https://imgur.com/1IKj5wT)

I'll take a quick detour here to mention bearing types - the two main types of bearings you'll see are cup and cone or sealed. Cup and cone are angular contact bearings that are user-serviceable. You can disassemble them and replace the balls or put in fresh grease. What's growing more popular, however, is sealed bearings that are a non-serviceable assembly. These are typically not angular contact - instead of a cup and cone shaped races, the bearing races are two inner sleeves. These theoretically have less capability reacting lateral loads, because there's nothing supporting the balls laterally. They aren't serviceable, but they can be replaced entirely for pretty cheap, so that's the tradeoff. 

Alright, let's move on to standards. The front wheel is easy, you've got really only two OLDs to worry about - 100mm (QR or TA) and 110mm Boost. Now, why would we want different OLDs? Simple. The rim is *always* centered on the hub. With a 100mm hub, both locknuts are 50mm from the centerline of the rim. That gives you plenty of room between your two flanges. Until, that is, you decide that you want to install disc brakes. Now, our left side flange has to come inboard, because we need room to squeeze in a disc rotor on that side. What that means is that the distance between the flanges has decreased. Less flange distance means that the wheel has less lateral strength, which I'll get into when we talk about spokes and spoke bracing angle. However, if we go to a 110mm front hub spacing, that gives us an extra 5mm on each side to play with. This extra width lets us maintain a nice wide flange distance while still having a disc rotor. Oh, and it means that everyone needs to buy new wheels for their MTB, but that's a happy little accident for the bike companies, right? 

[Pic 4: Front axles](https://imgur.com/tQ7Jta4)

Now let's go around to the rear. We've got a lot more on the menu here. We could have 110mm, which is some old single-speeds. 120mm, which is newer single-speeds or some older 5-speeds. 126mm, which is road 6/7 speed. 130mm is a modern road 8/9/10/11 speed and unless you specifically go looking for something else, that's what a rim brake road bike wheelset will have. 135mm is the standard for hybrids and mountain bikes, as well as disc brake roadies. Now, here's where it gets tricky. When they developed thru axles, they added a 3.5mm shoulder on each side which slides into a stepped notch on the frame. So 135mm quick release is essentially the same rear spacing as 142mm thru axle. The cassette, flanges, and rotor are all in the same place whether you have 135mm QR or 142mm TA. Finally, there's Boost, which is 141mm QR (uncommon) or 148mm TA. Hmmm, 3.5mm x 2 = 7mm. 135mm + 7mm = 142mm. 141mm + 7mm = 148mm. The math checks out. The downside of this is that as hubs get wider, chainstays get wider, and you start to sacrifice heel clearance if you've got big feet. 

[Pic 5: rear axles](https://imgur.com/RGCGcrV)

So, why so many standards? Over the years, freehubs have grown longer as more cogs have been added. Plus, disc rotors have come along and taken up extra space. For a strong and stiff wheel, you want a decent spoke bracing angle. If you look at the 130mm 11-speed road hub, it's got an extremely shallow bracing angle on the drive side - the hub flange is very close to the centerline. Going to a wider hub lets you move out the hub flanges and still have room for everything, giving you a stronger wheel. 

However, one concern here is chainline. Most road cranksets assume you've got a 130mm rear hub. Going to 135mm means that the entire cassette slides 2.5mm outboard, so now the centerline of the chainrings doesn't line up to the centerline of the cassette. In practice, it's not a huge deal, since you're rarely in the small-small chainring/cog combinations that are most affected. 

[Pic 6: Chainline](https://imgur.com/UxSXC1k)

But it's been an issue manufacturers have wrestled with, especially on disc brake bikes with shorter chainstays (the shorter the chainstay, the sharper angle the chain will have for a given amount of lateral misalignment). That's also why you see manufacturers offering 'Boost' and 'non-Boost' mountain bike cranksets - Boost moves the cassette out by 3mm, so for optimal performance you want the chainring to go outboard by 3mm as well - it increases Q-factor but has better chain alignment. And of course, I'm not going to get through this section without a dishonorable mention of the short-lived Specialized 'SCS' (Short Chain Stay) standard. What SCS (in its 135mm QR incarnation) does is takes a 135mm QR hub and shifts the freehub (and ONLY the freehub) inboard by 2.5mm. That's all. The OLD is still 135mm, the rim is still centered, the rotor is in the same place. But the freehub is shifted inboard 2.5mm to line up with where it would be if you had a 130mm rear hub. This gives you a narrower flange distance, but improves chainline for road cranksets with short chainstays. To make it work, there's a special derailleur hanger that offsets the rear derailleur inboard by 2.5mm as well so that the indexing all still works. You can go back to a standard 135mm QR disc wheelset just by swapping to a derailleur hanger that doesn't have that 2.5mm offset, which they sell. That's not so bad. Except wait, there's another SCS variant, which is a 135mm thru axle. That's right, the other SCS variant is a essentially a 130mm road spaced hub, with a disc squeezed in there, and then they put a 2.5mm shoulder (not the 3.5mm shoulder that took us from 135mm to 142mm earlier) on it. That's totally wonky and bizarre. 

[Pic 7: SCS](https://imgur.com/ESv2bTq)

A note on conversion: There’s a lot going on now, but in many cases the only difference is the endcaps in the hub. Remember, if you look back at our thru-axle hubs, there is a bunch of space inside the hollow axle. There’s more than enough space to adapt to multiple diameter thru-axles or even to have a quick release skewer. Many nicer hubs have adapter kits to replace the endcaps. If they were originally designed for thru axles, you can replace the endcaps with plugs that simulate the protruding ends of the quick release axle that slide into the dropout. However, it won’t work for all hubs – if they are originally designed around a narrower axle, you can’t fit a larger thru-axle in there. 
In the olden days, you could rebuild some rear wheels to different OLD spacings by playing with the nuts. With the cup and cones on the threaded axle, you would get the cones spaced and then could add spacers to go to a larger OLD, such as 126mm to 130mm, if the axle was long enough. You’d have to re-dish the wheel – remember, the cassette is always as far to the right as possible, so any spacers you add are only on the non-drive-side. The rim always must be centered on the hub, so adding 4mm of spacers to the non drive side of a 126mm hub would put the rim 2mm off-center, and you’d have to adjust spoke tension or spoke length to bring it back to center. 

[Pic 8: Conversion](https://imgur.com/uIQ6wAH)

Finally, I suppose we need to talk about freehubs and disc mounts. Disc mounts are easy, there are basically two options – Centerlock or 6-Bolt. 6-Bolt uses, you guessed it, 6 bolts on a circle to bolt on a rotor. 

[Pic 9: 6-Bolt](https://imgur.com/f0AeE1M)

Centerlock uses a splined interface with a lockring. Centerlock rotors can be a bit more expensive, but a lot of the higher end road bike rotors are only available in Centerlock. It is possible to put a 6 bolt rotor onto a centerlock hub with an adapter, so I can’t really see any good reason to buy a 6-bolt hub in this day and age. One thing to mention, however, is that there are two different Centerlock lockrings – internal and external. The internal lockring installs using a cassette lockring tool, but only if the hub is set up for 12mm thru-axles. A 15mm thru-axle is too large to fit the internal lockring around, so you’ll need an external lockring. This installs with a bottom bracket tool. The internal lockring comes in the box with the rotor, the external lockring must be purchased separately. 

[Pic 10: Centerlock](https://imgur.com/93l3aEb)

For freehubs, we’re crossing the line from talking about hubs to talking about drivetrains. Suffice it to say, there are a handful of standards – Shimano/SRAM 8/9/10 speed, Shimano/SRAM 11 speed, Campagnolo, SRAM XD Driver, and coming soon will be Shimano Microspline. Get the right thing that you need for your cassette. Unfortunately, I don’t own enough of these to take pictures of. Some hubs may be convertible between some/all of the freehub standards, some aren’t.

The trainingpeaks articles on the topic seem to imply that you set them based on inflections in the power curve. I seem to have inflections around 30s, 4min, 10min, and then \~25min. Would it make sense to set the 30s as the upper level of the anaerobic zone and then the 4minute duration as the upper level of the VO2 zone?

840,"Looking for a new aero bike in the neighborhood of $8k I'm planning to purchase a new aero bike this spring, and would love to hear any experiences with bikes around this price point. I don't race, but do fast group rides and solo efforts. I'm looking specifically for electronic shifting, disc brakes, and prefer internally routed cables. I was hoping to get my dream bike in this build but it looks to be far outside my price point. That would be the Bianchi Oltre XR4 Disc. Sadly, it's only offered as a frameset or with very high end builds, putting the cost north of 11k. Jumping down a tier, the XR3 Disc only comes in black, which sounds dumb but is a dealbreaker nonetheless, celeste or bust. Other bikes I'm strongly considering are:

**Canyon Aeroad 9.0 DA Di2**

The value from the Canyon is clearly the highest, and it looks way sharp in the new blue fade. That said, I'd be buying it blind with no real way to test ride it, to my knowledge, which makes me nervous.

**BMC TimeMachine Road 01 Three**

Everything I want at the max end of my budget.  

**Pinarello Prince Disc**

Cheaper, heavier, not as sold on the colorways, but could afford a power meter on top of the bike.

**3T Strada**

The 1x Road groupset really interests me, but I don't know how I would feel about it in practice.  I'm in central MN, so there's nothing too big, but I try to do at least one trip per year that has some real elevation to it.

**Cervelo S5 Disc**

**Look 795 Blade RS**

Of these, we have a BMC, Cervelo, Pinarello, and Look dealer within driving distance where I should be able to ride before I buy. The Madone and Venge are also on my radar, but they don't quite excite me like the others on my list. Are they good enough to compromise how I feel about them? I would love to hear any thoughts or experiences with any of these, particularly Canyon, as that buying experience makes me most wary.

845,"3rd year crit racing - new budget bike Hi! Long time /r/velo lurker here.

Pretty self-explanatory title; a little background info--
Started expanding to road cycling about 3 years ago after getting a sweet $900 deal on a used 2002 Cippollini Allez (50cm?) with a mix of SRAM/Shimano 10sp that I ran with Hed Belgiums laced to ultegra hubs.  Wonderful bike, light, nimble, awesome for going fast until I crashed hard in August and significantly dented the top tube and broke the front wheel.  Fast forward to now, and looking for a new bike this year and beyond that will suit me on a BUDGET*** for Cat 3/4/5 races &amp; crits.
I'm thinking it makes no sense to continue to invest in 10sp now and am looking to build a more modern mass start-y 11sp bike.  Fairly knowledgeable and up-to-date about the industry at large, Taiwanese factories, branding, markup, yada yada so not necessarily looking for big brands if I can find a deal. (I love Allez' but not impressed with this year's lineup/MSRP's) Continuing to seek smaller 47-51ish frame sizes for me (5'6"" / 29"" inseam)



Things I would love/prefer:

* 1x SRAM / 2x SRAM
* tight-ish geo
* disc? -- probably not happening
* Under $2k

My heaviest considered options so far:



[Giant TCR Advanced 2](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/tcr-advanced-2)
**$1900**
+ Best value *big-brand* model I'm finding right now.
+ Full 105
+ tested geo &amp; quality CF frame
- Price(?)


~~[PlanetX Pro Carbon Evo](https://www.planetx.co.uk/c/q/bikes/road-bikes/pro-carbon-evo)~~
~~**(~$1100 - $1500)**~~

[Holdsworth Super Professional](https://www.planetx.co.uk/c/q/bikes/road-bikes/holdsworth-super-professional)
**(~$1100 - $1500)**
+ Aero-est of the bunch
+ pricing is competitive
+ Would consider Rival 22 / Force 22 build options
+ Vision comp wheels
- Relatively unknown, but seeing these pop up.  Thoughts?
- Molded carbon T700


[Cinelli Vigorelli Road](https://www.cinelli-usa.com/cinelli-vigorelli-road-bike/)
**($1599)**
(out of left field on this list?)
+ Cinelli swag/bling lol
+ Colombus lightweight steel hey!
+ I have access to a discount on Cinelli, though unsure of specific on this model
+ One colorway only, but that purple is awesome
- Overall, kinda crappy stock components &amp; wheels, but will be upgrading constantly over time

**edit - NOT picky on frame material.  It's 2019 and there's new alu/steel tarriffs in the US.  IMO CF frame bikes are showing up a bit more competitive with alloy frames by price.**

**edit 2 - Most people seem to be pro Cannondale....I can't wrap myself around the tubing &amp; geo of CAADs :(**

**edit 3 - No SRAM options recommended? :(**

I am more heavily used to track/fg bikes, so open to all suggestions.  Hopefully someone can see where I'm coming from as a regular yung'un working joe/critthusiast.
If anyone has a used bike similar to these, I'd be interested to inquire as well.

Has anyone else had the same or similar experience?  I'm hoping I just got a crummy rep.  But if this is the norm it's seriously degrading my opinion of the company.

I contacted them a week ago and it's been an intermittent back and forth of one sentence responses from the support rep.  Then it takes about 2 days for him to reply with another one sentence reply.  The one that really threw me over the edge was his latest reply asking for my shipping address, which I had already supplied a week ago.

EDIT: After waiting two days after I paid for my replacement spacer and freehub (which I'm annoyed about - but whatever, I just want my Kickr to freewheel again) I finally called their phone line.  The first time I opted to stay on hold for the estimated four minutes - but at the end of my four minutes I just got a message about how they were sorry they couldn't get to me and then I was hung up on.  [Rage Face].  So I called back, this time I opted to get in line for a call back.  Remarkably, I was called back in about 10 minutes, and the very helpful woman I spoke with was able to get my part shipped out to me with overnight shipping and I should have my replacement within the next couple hours.  

So I find myself simultaneously pleased and extremely annoyed.  I'm glad to have the situation resolved.  I'm so disappointed in the interactions leading up to that call that I'm seriously reconsidering switching my Garmin 520 to an Elemnt Bolt, and wondering if I should sell my Kickr and get something that won't burn up freewheels (something that is apparently considered normal wear and tear that I find ridiculous).

858,"Spesh Allez Sprint- Disc or rim? What's up everyone,

I am going to come in to some money soon and am planning on building up a Specialized Allez Sprint and I would love to hear your opinions on getting the disc version vs the rim version!

I have a full 105 R7000 groupset on my current ride, so if I went for the disc version I would need to buy new brakes and shifters, but if I went with rim, I'd be able to just swap everything over. Additionally, I would have to buy a disc wheelset, while if I went with the rim I could keep using my current wheels (old first generation Zipp 303s with an aluminum brake track that is really worn down) albeit likely as a training wheelset. 

Pricewise, the disc frame is more expensive, plus I would need to buy brakes and shifters and a new disc wheelset. I'd bet all in it would be close to double the cost of just getting the rim version. 

I live in the mountains and frequently descend long steep roads, and rain is also pretty common. I recently rented a Scott with Ultegra disc brakes and really loved the feel and confidence that the brakes offered. 

I'm sorta thinking I should just pick up a rim brake frame and use all the money that I would be putting towards the disc frame (brakes, shifters, and wheelset) on getting a nice new set of carbon wheels to race on.

* What is your plan for winter? Road, off-road, turbo, or a combo?

* How many hours/miles/TSS are you planning to ride?

* Are you following a trainerroad/sufferfest/online program? Or are you self-coached?

* What has worked for you in previous winters?

* What will you do differently this winter?

* Are you following a specific approach, e.g. polarised, lots of SST, etc?

Me:

* Aiming to ride five days a week on the road using the turbo only when it's dangerous to ride outside. Of my three commuting days, five rides will be easy z1/z2 and one tempo effort on the way home. There'll be a harder session (e.g. 3x15' in zone 4), and a moderate session - usually the club ride.

* Aiming for 200 miles per week on average, TSS ranging from 500-700 between Jan to end of March (with recovery weeks 350-400 TSS).

* I don't follow a plan. Self-coached though I go through the Strava of faster riders to steal ideas.

* Last winter I was still new; riding lots.

* More structure, more curbing of enthusiasm.

* Nothing specific - keeping a lid on it with the aim of arriving at the beginning of the season in good shape and with a platform to build on. ",1

I'm still working on raising my FTP and lowering weight a bit more to get into a competitive power/weight ratio which I feel is roughly 3.17 in the W Cat 4/5 field. (2.08 watts/kg - August 2018, 2.4 watts/kg - Jan 2019). But I am well aware that this is only part of the equation. The other part, that I'm at a loss at, is skills during races. I know part of my problem for not being able to stick with the group is I don't have the skills to stay with them and this leads me to this post, where do I start for skills? Youtube videos? Drills? Finding a mentor who can help me? I really have no idea where to start but I know that one of my 2019 goals is to ride half a race with the Cat 4/5 group and that means at a minimum I need to learn to ride smart and not just off raw power.

891,"How to train for ultra-endurance Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

last year, I decided to get back to cycling a bit more seriously. I did some road and off-road in the past but I kind of gave it up because of university. Now in 2019, I decided to start some ultra-distance events. I'll be starting with 200km on the 23rd of march, then the events will start increasing in distance to finish with 600km somewhere in june. Right now I think I can handle the 200 and 300 km events since this summer I managed to do 100km at 25km/h average without much training.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is: how do I train for these kind of events? mostly now in the winter, when I can't really go and ride 4 hours in the cold and rain.. I have a very basic indoor trainer and a bike. No power meter, barely have a heart meter (it's just one of those smart watch, but not very accurate). How should I go about this?

893,"Tips for motivation on base training Hello fellas, 

I'm a student on low budget (so no paid coach) training for short distance events such as crits and short road races. I have about 7 years of triathlon to cycling under the belt, usually training 5 to 8 hours/week total. During those years, my bike strength as assessed by the Training Peaks chart has always been short efforts, 1min to 5min. I'm a puncheur!

Motivation/objective-wise, I don't quite care much to gain medals or podiums, but I relish the experience of improving and even going up a cat. Also, I'm doing sports mainly because I love expending myself regularly (my biggest fun happens at the end of a race with HR already above 190 and the sprint is just starting).

To the point : when I race, my problem usually is maintaining longer efforts, as I tend to be unable to stay motivated enough to train my base endurance. That leads me to underperform even at the end of 1h crits, as I've stayed in the red the whole race even when drafting.

During this fall, I've tried Zwift group rides, but they inevitably are harder (like 250W) or way easier (about 150W) than I think I should do for 2h base training (about 215W). Also, every of those planned ride I've instead done a zwift race, as I find MUCH harder to to by myself a 2h endurance ride than a good old 20 to 40min throw-your-lungs-out race averaging FTP (which actually fells rewarding, fun and systematically makes me want to bike again and more the next day). On the other hand, I dread FTP testing. Super though, haven't done one in the past year yet.

Since it's already January and what I planned as base period should end the 31st, I thought I'd give Xert a try. I signed up for a month and so far I'm enjoying the endurance workouts, which gives me a nice variety of intervals of 1 to 2min around 170 to 230W based on my lower threshold power of 222W (FTP 290W, HIE 29kJ). It's interesting, because other training programs I've seen so far usually just ask to keep a seemingly endless steady wattage that I find quite mentally taxing.

Is anyone on a similar boat? I'm not sure yet if Xert is going to be sufficient to help me solve that base problem and I'm really open to ideas/experience/critique.",1

902,"Did a 5"", 1', 5', and 20' test on the trainer... what is my power profile and what should I work on? Hello /r/velo,

Just a recreational cyclist here who has never raced before, but I've done many centuries and gran fondos. I entered an event that takes place mid-April that has lots of short, steep climbs and loops around for 94 miles. I'm doing lots of base miles and have built my endurance well but now I am trying to increase my fitness in various areas. I'd like to be competitive for once and not just stagger across the finish line.

I did a test (similar to Sufferfest's four dimensional power profile test) and came up with the following numbers:


Peak power: 1,201W

5"" power: 1,140W

1' power: 484W

5' power: 315W

20' power: 276W

Estimated FTP: 262W


My weight is 155 lbs/70 kg. My plan is to get down to 145 lbs/66 kg and increase my power a bit.

[Here is a picture of my power curve from Strava.](https://i.imgur.com/ph55e6t.png)

What are my strengths and weaknesses; what should I work to improve on? I am going to work on my Z2 and Z3 power since it is a long event, but I expect to have many threshold and VO2 efforts up the short climbs and holding onto other riders' wheels.

903,"60min power lower than predicted from 20min power My 60min power has consistently been lower than expected than my 20min power, usually around 90%.

I have a good relative natural 5min power, but my 20min/60min numbers have always proportionally lagged behind my 1min/5min power.  When I do intervals of 20min or less, I have to increase the power level (as a percentage of FTP) over the suggested zone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is that percentage fairly constant? Should I just accept it and work on max'ing my 20min power to max my FTP? Or do I need to start mixing in longer (40-60min) intervals to get my top end to improve?

904,"Time spent in HR zones I don't have a PM nor can I afford one (yet...) so I use HR to quantify my training. Just looking over this week's numbers:

230.1 miles

How does that compare to a normal week for you guys? Seems a lot of time in z1. Zones are from Training Peaks based on threshold, though I think they may be a bit off. Threshold is 180, zones: 1 - 0-144; 2 - 145-161; 3 - 162-168; 4 - 169-179; 5 - 180+.

1) Pedal based power. I have LOOK KEO cleats/pedals already, so I'm used to using their clip system.

Pros to this:


* Easy to install/swap if I ever get or want to use them on another bike.
* No compatibility issues on 99% of road bikes (if I get a new bike anytime)
* Already used to clip system


Cons: 

* Cost!!! I'll be looking at the upper end of my budget to spend on a PM, and I've noticed it's a bit more challenging to find them used for cheap.
* More exposed to crashes/etc


Options I'm looking are the favero pedals (can't find used so $420) and the p1 from powertap (used) single sided


2) Crank options (used stages, 4iiii, etc). I want to switch from a 50/34 to a 52/36 or 53/39 ratio as I live in a pancake flat area and don't need the 34, but would appreciate a higher gear, and a lower gear I can actually use. Unfortunately, I need to upgrade the whole crankset in that case. I'll need to switch out my chain regardless soon so that's not an issue.

Pros:


* Upgrade to a better crankset and switch chainrings to preferred gearing!
* Less exposed in a crash

Cons:


* Installation. I'd probably have to fork out some money to have my LBS installed as I don't have the tools (or knowledge) for swapping a crankset.
* Must find two things for relatively cheap (crank arm and crankset)
* Much higher chance of being incompatible in the future, and general compatibility issues.


I'd have to find some sort of combo of something used from Online Swap Meet groups/ebay for this to work. It's more work, but I'd get a new crankset out of this.

I've also looked into spider options but I found out from power tap's support that the c1 isn't compatible (that would solve this whole issue), and I'm not sure what people's opinions are on this issue. I'd also really prefer a direct force PM over something like power comp or similar.

925,"Will weight training hamper cycling performance? Hi! I’m still fairly new to cycling and fitness in general, as I’m only 17, so if I have misunderstood something, help would be greatly appreciated.

From what I’ve understood, we have 3 types of muscle fibers. Type I, which are slow twitch fibers used at lower intensities, like z1 and z2, Type IIa, which are used at intensities around FTP and VO2 max, and Type IIb, which are used in sprints and short explosive bursts. Now I’m not a sprinter, so I do most of my interval work to improve my climbing on climbs of around 5-20 minutes. So a lot of sweetspot, FTP and VO2 Max intervals, as well as longer rides of 2-4 hours with my friends. This riding creates Type I and Type IIa fibers right?

However, I also play football(soccer) as a goalkeeper, where diving and jumping requires very short, very explosive movements. This winter I’m thinking about going to the gym and working on my jump, with strength training, which would create a lot of Type IIb fibers right?

So my question is that if I start doing strength training, will that result in me loosing Type I and Type IIa fibers, and therefore make my performance on the bike worse, or will it build new muscle, and therefore not affect, or even improve my performance on the bike. I’m still going to do cycling of course, and the strength training would come in addition to all the other stuff.

Edit: Thanks for all the awesome replies! Looks like strength training won’t have a noticable negative impact, so I’ll start doing that as well.",1

But I've read on a few random articles here and there that water bottles actually do hurt aerodynamic gains that one might receive from aero frames or other aero components.

932,"How to determine whether weight training should be done? Hello all,

I often go back and forth on whether I should dedicate time and effort to weight training. I have been cycling / racing for about 3 years now, and have learned a lot during that time. I am either on Trainerroad or doing something purposefulon the bike outdoors instead.

I've ridden about 400 hours over each of those years. During this time my weight has not changed at all. My BMI is always in the range of upper 18's no matter what I eat, whether I exercise, etc. I am extremely lean, and because of this, I'm actually a much better runner than cyclist. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't care less about running (anymore). Weight seems less crucial in cycling than running (still extremely important), and it also seems beneficial to be a little stronger and heavier.

I compete in Cyclocross and MTB races pretty much from May to up to December. The weight room exercises I would be doing are things like Squat, Deadlift, overhead press, and core work.

Anecdotally, has anyone been in a similar position? I know I will get faster from riding more, but would weights help, too? How does one know when the weight lifting is having a negative impact on cycling performance (Detracting from cycling workouts, fatigue, etc)?",1

935,"Stage Gen 2 Buying Advice Hi all, I am looking to buy a power meter for my road bike but currently in a bit of a dilemma. Stages has a Ultegra 6800 Gen 2 crank arm on closeout for $300 which should work great with my setup. 

Now the hesitation comes from reports of people complaining about poor ANT+ signal transmission / reception between this generation of Stages PM and Garmin computers. The consensus being that if you have your Garmin mounted on the handlebar vs up front mount there is no dropout in signal. Is there anything else I need to know that can be a deal breaker? Essentially I want to know if I should go ahead with this deal given the low price.

Appreciate any input.

937,"Carbon Wheelset choice help: Hi,

I've been considering, admittedly on and off, about getting a new set of hoops.  I'm currently running HED Belgium+ clinchers laced to King R45 hubs.  They've been nothing short of bomb-proof.  I'm looking at a few rims as upgrades, new and used at the moment.  

First up: Mavic Ksyrium Pro carbon SL-C (clincher full carbon)

https://roadcyclinguk.com/gear/mavic-ksyrium-pro-carbon-sl-c-carbon-clincher-wheelset-review.html

These are very nice looking wheels and are very light and well reviewed for the most part.  I've found a lightly used set for $1250 CAD which I'm going to look at soon.  They're only 25mm in depth, so nothing overly aero.  

The second wheelset I'm looking at is by FSE:
Price varies depending on hub choice (DT 240 vs FSE stock). 

http://fse.bike/product/evo-35-45ct-carbon-fiber-clincher-tubeless-wheelset/

This would be bought new and price comes in around $1850 with the  FSE hub.  This combo is both lighter lighter than the Mavic and would offer some good aero-ness. With the DT240 hubs, I'm looking at about $2375CAD before taxes. 

I'm leaning towards the new FSE wheelset as it seems like the obvious choice (price aside), but would love anyone's real-world experience to shed some light on the specs of both of these rims.    Their intended use would be All-around rims, ridden in the Pacific Northwest by a 140lb fairly strong rider, often in endurance and hilly races.  Also, would the DT240's be a worthy upgrade for the FSE wheelset?

I got into cycling last spring. I bought a used 2015 Allez comp which is great and has gotten me through most the winter. I live in a cold snowy climate so I am planning on making it my winter bike and whichever new bike I buy my main bike.  

My interests in biking are crits and triathlons.  I am currently training for a 70.3 for May. 

The bikes I'm deciding between:

* TCR Advanced Disc KOM - 2018 Ultegra (105 cassette), Giant PR-2 Disc wheelset
,  $2520
* Aeroad CF SLX Disc 8.0 - 2018 Full Ultegra, REYNOLDS STRIKE SLG CARBON TUBELESS,  $3000
* Ultimate CF SL Disc 8.0  - 2018 Full Ultegra, DT SWISS P 1800,  $2800
* Emonda SL 6 Disc          - $3150

Only problem caynon bikes are currently out of stock and I have no clue if they will come back in at the same price point.

I noticed that I was close to pinch flat 3 times on the trial before it finally puncture when I entered a little stream at full speed. 

So I swapped the tube today and I got a bike shop to set the tyre for me with their pressure pump. 

I put back the wheel the way I saw fit. I have true-axel or whatever it’s called and tbh I don’t really know what I was doing but I think I made it. It seems to sit solid. 

There is absolutely no rubbing of the disk breaks so I assumed the rim was put in perfectly. 

But there is quite the wobble when riding. 

So is it possible the rim came untrue when I got my pinch flat? Or is it something off with the way I put the wheel back on? Is it possible to not put it in correct when one has tru-axle?

Or did I actually destroy the rim when I got my pinch flat? There are no dents on the rim or anything.

1003,"Advice - Reentry to the Sport Good morning!

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about 10 years since I have done any mountain biking, but I am looking to get back into the sport. My wife and I have been getting back into bikes for exercises, and I am fortunate enough to have a system of singletrack trails within riding distance of my home, only a few tenths of a mile away.

&amp;#x200B;

Presently, I am riding about a 10 year old Specialized Rockhopper Comp with a Rockshox Tora and Avid mechanical disc brakes. It is not a bad bike, but I think it is way too big for me. I recall the guy at the shop encouraging me to go for a larger sized frame. I am 5'11"" and it is a 21"" frame, which I believe is an XL. The bike is alright for riding, but it seems almost impossible to manuever at any speed around tight turns. I think I am missing out on the mountain bike experience by having a poorly sized bike, plus the technology and components are dated.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I started to research bikes. I am torn between a hardtail and full suspension bike. 10 years ago, full suspension bikes were not as affordable as they are today, at least something that was serviceable. I really like the lineup for Diamondback, given I can get the bike shipped directly to my house. Like I said, my prior experience with shops was not great, and I did not like the pressure to buy something that was in stock, which I feel is why I was pushed into the larger frame with the Rockhopper.  I want the bike for riding Pennsylvania trails, not much in terms of hardcore downhill. I really like flowing track rather than anything too technical, at least in this stage of my experience. Also, it would be nice for the bike to be serviceable for rail to trails and casual family riding, given my wife is riding (road mainly) and we purchased a trailer for our kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that, I have been leaning toward a Diamondback Sync'R, Specialized Fuse 27.5, and Diamondback Atroz 3. For the price range, $1,200 to $1,400, these bikes seem to be well spec'd. I am a little bummed the Diamondbacks do not have dropper posts, but I suppose that can be an update. The pros and cons and balancing of the components is what overwhelms me. I really don't understand the nuance in each fork, all come with solo air Rockshox designs, which seems good for me. But, is there a big difference in these? I think the Sync'R and Atroz have the better fork, the Recon RL versus the Fuse with the Judy TK Silver. I am leaning toward the Diamondbacks, but am not sure if I would be better suited with a hardtail versus full suspension. I understand there are some advantages of the hardtail, but it sounds as though the primary issues in the past with full suspension, a lack of efficiency, have been worked out for the most part. I feel like the Atroz may be a better choice, and I may be regretting the hardtail if I go with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so I'm getting kind of fed up with my Trek Marlin 6, I bought it as a starter bike ($680~) because I wasn't sure I was going to ride as much as I am. So fast forward and I'm riding trails and getting really into it. I was wanting to go to a single chain ring. Spent $100 at a bike shop for a chain ring, chain, and bolts, only to find out that my crank arms have plastic crap to make it look like it's a removable chain ring but it's not. So I took the stuff back. I'm all for supporting my local shops, but I ordered the stuff on amazon to get the chain ring I wanted (raceface) because the shops didn't have it. I ordered SRAM crank arms, Chester raceface pedals, bolts, and a nice durable chain. So today I get home, and the spindle length is 127.5 mm,  instead of whatever the standard is. So I have to order a $60 adapter kit that comes with new crank arms to actually get this to work. Looked around and only Trek is using this weird size, and only on their entry level bikes. Are they putting these parts on just to make it harder to upgrade the bikes or what?! Only thing that makes sense to me. I want to just buy a new bike but I love the frame, and it's my first nice bike. I'm gonna go through with the upgrade but damn if I'm not finding out this bike really wasn't worth the money.",0
1009,"Tips on preventing chain slipping/skipping? Recently in the past few months I have become a new member of the MTB community. I picked up a [cheap entry level bike](http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/fsx_1.htm) with my tax return this year, and so far have replaced the handlebars with wider ones, wider tires with more tread, added a shorter stem and new pedals. 

I havn't had a whole lot of free time to go out and ride too much yet, but I have been out to my local trail (5-6 mi. long) probably about 6 times now, and have traveled a town over twice now for a trail over there. Just recently my 2nd time at the trail a town over my chain ended up breaking around 2 miles into an 8 mile long trail, leaving me to walk the 2 miles back to my parked car. Since then I have a new, nicer quality chain on the way.

Reason for my title is so far the biggest issue I have had with my bike is the chain skipping/slipping. This really sucks when I am  coming up to a decent climb and my chain slips, therefore causing me to lost some if not all of my momentum. Obviously with my bike of choice it did not come with a derailleur that has the luxury of a clutch included with it.

1011,"Drained some oil out of the damper side of my Fox Float 32 O/B to solve the suspected issue of an overfilled damper. Need some help with notchy feel at a specific point of the forks travel after closing everything back up Following the Fox guide, I removed the compression and rebound adjusters from the top of my fork, while leaving the lower legs on. I gently pulled the damper further out of the fork until it stopped (cannot be completely removed because it was still screwed in through the lower legs), and then compressed the fork to push oil to the top. Using a syringe, I drained the oil out until the fork could reach full travel without oil spilling out the top. I put the top cap back on without the rebound and lockout to test the forks function. It feels smooth until about 30% in, where it seems to hit a notch, and it requires some extra force to break through to the rest of the travel, which once again feels smooth. 

I'm not sure what could cause this as there is still plenty of oil in the damper side and I didn't mess with the spring side. Initially, I thought it was possible that the fork was locked, but it doesn't make sense since when this fork is locked, there is only a few mm of movement allowed, not the ~50mm that it travels before hitting the ""stop"". I rode around and cycled the fork at my normal PSI in an attempt to fix the issue, but it's still not any better.

I just bought a new Cube Nutrail fatbike 10 days ago and it has some issues. It's a 2x10 speed bike and the first issue I noticed was that on higher gears, like 15-20 the chain would start making noise(clicking) at the front derailleur. I don't remember my old regular 27-speed MTB ever doing that from 1-27 gearshifts.

I took it back to the shop and the bike tech told me it's fixed. I tried it and it was. But just for testing purposes I tried gears from 1-10 and now they were clicking(chain was making contact?) instead, more noticeably than the higher gears.
I rode back and told him about it and he said that's normal? I either choose to have the clicking/chain dragging on the lower gears or the higher gears, I can't have it without. Something about the chain being tilted with 1 setting or the other. Honestly it made no sense to me since when I rode bikes before, none of them had this issue. But I took him at his word and rode home.

2 days later after some light trail riding and commuting to work on my way home the feeling in the pedals suddenly changed and it was making this horrible, loud rumbling noise like inside the crankarm and your feet could feel the wobble/wiggle inside from the pedals. And it was clicking on higher gears again. I was scared to go fast since I thought I would crash, seemed like the crank would just fall off at any second.

Any advice you guys could offer would be appreciated. Is what the bike tech said is true? I feel like I paid ~2000EUR/2200USD for defective bike/bad assembly job. For that money the bike shouldn't be making any noise, rumble, clicking, right?",0

She's not the best but she want to keep at it.

1035,"When changing your suspension setup, remember you might not be able to pedal all the places you could before. Oops! I had been riding with my suspension and sag set incorrectly on a new bike, and got around to getting it sorted recently. I had been riding with it too stiff so I decreased sag by about 15% front and rear with the new set up. I also flipped my bike's geometry adjustment link to make it lower and slacker on the same day. So the bike was much lower than it had been.  

I warned myself when I hit the trails that I need to be careful of pedal strikes, but I was having too much fun and went flat out in a pedally section with some rocks I could normally clear. I clipped one, instant ejecto off the bike and snapped my collar bone into more bits than it should be in.

1041,"Fork can't be rebuilt, what are my options? I recently got a 2012 Specialized Stumpjumper for $500 on craigslist. It seemed in good shape, the LBS where I bought it checked it out and gave it a thumbs up, said there were no red flags. So I've been riding it for about a month, and recently noticed oil on my fork along with damaged seals. After taking it for service, my LBS recommended a fork rebuild and called Fox to see about sending it in, but Fox can't rebuild the fork because they don't make the parts for a fork that old.

A little bit more about my riding style. I ride the blue trails at Northstar and maybe want to start hitting the easier blacks soon, but not necessarily this season. I also ride All Mountain trails in the Reno / Tahoe area. I don't jump or do big drops, but do like to ride the downhills as fast as I can and push my comfort zone as I progress. My current goals are to stay in the saddle, try to go faster downhill, and have fun.

And FYI, I don't really want to invest much more $ into this bike, it was supposed to be a starter bike for this season to ride at Northstar and see how much I liked DH. I was already planning on getting a nicer bike next season or the following. I was ok spending up to $200 on the rebuild, but now that's not an option.

So, I'd like to know:

1) Is this a critical issue red flag kind of problem? What would happen if I kept riding this season on the current fork without a rebuild? A potential catastrophic injury, or just worse handling / performance over time? It still feels ok to me, not sticky, no strange noises, not bottoming out as far as I can tell, etc.

2) Should I forget about the bike, accept the sunken cost, and ride my old hardtail at Northstar until I can afford a new bike next year? Buying a 7-year-old bike at that price, I always knew this was a risk.

3) Should I just get a new fork? If I can spend less than $500 for the parts and installation, and keep my overall costs under $1000, I would still consider doing this, but would rather put that $ toward a new bike. Any recommendations?

Also FYI, I'm fairly new to the mtb scene and don't have much technical knowledge yet, so I appreciate any advice!

TL;DR Would I be ok riding my fork into the ground this season without a rebuild, and save up for a better bike next year?",0

1043,"Got charged by a very angry mama moose on my ride today. Stay safe out there fellow MTBers. Was riding my usual trail and just sending it when I came around a corner hot and almost ran directly into a mama moose and her baby. I knew I was in a bad spot so I threw the bike down and just started running up the hill next to the trail yelling for my buddies to stop where they were behind me. I caught up to them and explained to them what happened. We agreed to stay in a group and make lots of noise as we move back to where I had left my bike. We got to my bike and it seemed the moose had left so we cautiously kept walking down the trail. About 2 min later we hear then see the mother moose coming up the trail towards us pretty fast. We ditch our bikes and all 3 of us run up the hill and put some space between her and us. We hang out for 10 maybe 15 min just hoping she moves along. We decide it's clear and head down to pick up the bikes. Get to the bikes and were all a little winded and wary but no moose, so were feeling good. I hop on the bike first and start riding. I did not get more than 50 feet from the other riders when I heard a sound I never want to hear again. The mother was full tilt rushing at me from my right side out of the shadows. Apparently her issue was just with me because she completely ignored my buddies who were just getting on their bikes and kept gunning on a collision course for me. I start pedaling like my life depends on it cuz it probably did but as I looked into her eyes I could she was gaining on me. I launched off the bike into a full sprint of my own back uphill just trying to put some trees between me and her. I somehow got behind a boulder and broke line of sight and was able to get back to my riding buddies. I really hadn't lost her tho and right then she came back into view. I ran one way and one buddy followed the other I guess seeing his moment to potentially not die hopped on his bike and blasts past her as shes still coming after me. Fun. We run completely exhausted now uphill further trying to put anything we can (trees, boulders, bushes, ditches) between her and us. After a couple minutes (that felt way too long) she lost interest in pursuing as she must have decided her baby was safe now. We wait 30 min this time then I walk back down and collect the bikes as my buddy who stayed with me was in no shape to run from the moose again if need be. Fortunately she had moved on and I was able to retrieve both bikes and we rode out. 

TL:DR Stay safe on the trail cuz you never know what's around the corner.

Edit to add this except about the proper way to deal with a charging moose.

""An aggressive, confrontational moose is trying to do one thing: drive you off. So if a moose approaches you, back away. If it charges, RUN! Do not stand your ground. If possible, place a tree or other nearby object between you and the moose as you retreat. Once the moose has driven you far enough away, it will leave you alone. If the moose does make contact, it typically strikes first with its front hooves, using its rear legs occasionally in a prolonged assault. If a moose knocks you down, continue your efforts to escape. Sustained assaults are rare, however, and the odds of a fatal attack are extremely low.""",0

Pacing was by far the biggest part of it, keeping in a nice easy gear.

I've been riding my local trail which is pretty technical with a lot of rocks/boulders and roots. Really have to find a good line through the rocks a lot of the time. I don't have much skill but I've been getting a lot better at climbing through rocks and stuff. My current bike just really isn't cutting it though. It's a 2015 Giant Revel 29 that probably cost $600 brand new. It's big, heavy, clunky, and badly needs a tune up. Not a fan of 29"" tires either. Just too cumbersome feeling on a tight trail. 

I feel like a decent HT would be a massive upgrade. I've been checking out the Commencal Meta HT AM Essential and it looks great. Seems like its a light aggressive bike. I like the low weight and simplicity of a HT. Would a HT be better for a beginner looking to improve my skills? 

I've also been looking on pinkbike for used bikes. I've found a few FS that look good. I'm hesitant on the FS bikes because I know they're much more maintenance and I'm looking at 4-5 year old bikes that cost more money that the new HTs I'm looking at.

So finally I was able to get my bike out of the garage and I’m stoked. Repaired what needed to be repaired and I’m on the final steps. 

I already adjusted my front derailleur and am almost done with the rear derailleur too. 
I did this for the first time ever all by myself! 
Thanks to the park tools videos, they’re really great! 

Now the last thing that needs to be done is the b-screw. 

The video mentions that the distance between the cassette and the derailleur roll should be about 5-6 millimeters when shifted the the smallest cogs in the front and the back. 

But I have a BIG gap between them. Like 32 mm. 
And my chain isn’t under tension at all. By loosening the b-screw I could reduce the gap to about 17 mm, but at the cost of introducing even more slack to the system. 

What should I do? More slack and smaller gap?
Less slack and bigger gap?

1093,"Looking for pedal recommendations for a guy with little ankle movement I'm currently riding a Niner Hard tail with Race Face Aeffect pedals. I ride in central florida, so lots of flats with sand and roots. 

I've been having problems with shin bites, fairly severe ones and especially on the left side. Both of my ankles have fairly limited movement (about 10-15 degree of flex in each direction). My left ankle is fused, which is also the shin that takes the brute of the punishment. 

I know part of my problem is that I am still very new (3 months with roughly 400 miles down). I purchased a set of 5.10 freerider pro's about a month ago which made a huge difference initially but I feel like I'm back to having problems often. 

I'm wondering if a different set pedals could make a difference. Anyone have any experience or thoughts?",0
1094,"Need Help Choosing Bike TL;DR at bottom.

I live in the PNW and plan on using a new bike as a ""do-everything"" kind of bike. Which, I know, is super un-original and hard to do. I want a bike that I can swap road tires onto when I ride around town with my girlfriend and have the ability to take it on single track rides with a mix of uphill and downhill. I talked to my buddy about MTBs and he said, ""I would go FS and just spend the money up front."" After some research I found I'm nowhere near that price point for a decent FS down hill bike. 

I decided a solid Hard Tail would be the best option for riding on trails and taking to the streets when I decide to. But now I'm stuck in a limbo of finding bikes that might be too specific, with bad components, or not very upgrade-able.

I would like to get a bike from my LBS because they do free tune-ups in the off season and they are incredibly friendly and helpful. But only two guys work there at a time so I'd like to see more responses from the general public on Reddit.

These are essentially the bikes I have narrowed my search down to.

I want to upgrade the seat with a dropper post, get a better front shock in the next 6 months, and have wheels with tire options. I am a big fan of the free style bike frame because if I do want to go downhill, I'm setup for a ride that doesn't feel like I'm going to endo. I am comfortable riding down stairs and doing small bunny hops to get up and down curbs, so I'm somewhat experienced. But I would take input from people who are far more experienced than I am.

I've searched for used bikes on Facebook/PinkBike/Craigslist because they are all 26 inchers and I want the better momentum of the larger wheel sets.

I've been searching around for a couple weeks now trying to decide what kind of bike I want. I have a single speed bike in the garage that I don't really use because it doesn't have gears (which is funny because I bought a single speed for it's low maintenance). Now I want to get back onto a mountain bike. Problem is, the last bike I had was a department store bike and I haven't seen any trail time. 


**TL;DR** 
This what I have found for a potential bike. Can they be upgraded easily? Will they work both on and off the trail with street tires?

I have been riding to and from work most days, and at work as well (I direct a kids camp). While on a trail ride today, I had some issues shifting to a 2-2 or a 2-3, where the chain just wouldn’t move to the next numerically lower gear. I figured my rear derailleur and indexing needed to be adjusted. 


I’ve watched countless videos and today I spent three hours trying to get it honed in. 


I got frustrated and got it good enough to ride home, but it’s still not super perfect.  I’m still getting some crappy shifting while in  2nd on the crank gears.

Up until the last 2 rides, it has given me no issues at all, but now the chain skips teeth on the rear sprocket during hard acceleration.

I have an old 2011 Carrera Vengeance budget hardtail which had mechanical Tektro OI disc brakes and QR skewers. They rubbed a lot despite re-centering the calliper. I decided that the rotors must be bent due to the Tekros being only a single piston design.

I upgraded the Tektros to some Clarks M2 hydraulic two piston brakes instead, complete with new rotors. but the rubbing continues.  I have re-centered the callipers, by loosening the two bolts, holding  the brake lever, and tightening again. But I'm still getting rub.

1151,"2018 vs 2020 Stump Jumper Comp Alloy 29er? Hey guys - been lurking this sub for a hot minute but finally decided to post something here, hoping to get reddit's advice on a new purchase. First, let me say - I'm definitely not a crazy technical rider, but I do enjoy a good time on the trail (I do not consider myself an expert by any means). I've been rocking a hardtail (diamondback overdrive) which has treated me well over the past few years but I've outgrown it and I've saved up enough to splurge on an FS. In the immediate area of the DMV, I've got limited options without driving crazy far and there a few dealers that carry a stumpjumper and I've settled on this being a great value for the price. 

I've researched other subs and have found a lot of information on the old stump jumper 2018 vs new 2019 + 2020 model. A local shop (I'm in Washington D.C) has three bikes:  the new 2019 ST, 2019 comp alloy and an older SJ frame which is the 2018 stump jumper Comp Alloy 29er. The newer 2019 SJ ST is a bit more bare-bones coming in at around $1,800, but it has frame improvements over the previous years. Has no dropper post, and not the best components.   On the other hand, the 2019 Comp alloy is beefier but is significantly more expensive coming in at $3,000. What I'm leaning towards is a middle ground between the two, The older 2018 Comp Alloy model is priced at $2,300 (MSRP is $2,800). It has an older frame, but very solid components. 

The 2018 has been sitting in the shop for quite some time, probably over a year and I know they will give me a discount. He said around $500 off list which will get me to $2,300 all in. I will probably try to haggle him a bit further. 

My question is, with the new frame/geometry and the complete redesign of the SJ product line - is it worth sacking up and spending a bit more to get a 2019 comp alloy?

I've finally got the funds saved up to get off my current 2010 Frankensteined hardtail. I was looking for options on bikes under 1300$ that were still relatively aggressive. 1150$ if there's not already a dropper post included.

Are there any other good options out there? I was thinking an aggressive hardtail would be good because of budget constraints.

1176,"Downsizing from a medium to a small? Hi, 


I've got a solid opportunity to buy a 2018 Rocky Mountain Altitude C50 for a very good price.

It is a rather decent upgrade from my Scott Spark 960 since I mostly ride enduro and tech trails (the Rocky is slacker, lighter and has much better components).

The only downside is that it is a Small sized frame and not a medium like my Scott.

Being 5'7"" (170cm), I'm on the line between a small and a medium. Some websites tell me I should buy a small where as other tells me I should buy a medium.

Should I go ahead and grab it?

I've looked at the geometry numbers and the reach is about 15mm shorter (432 vs 416). 

Does the stem length influence the reach measurement? (The Spark has a 60mm stem where as the Rocky has a really short one).

What else is to consider when downsizing a bike frame?",0

Also, if you have any comparable bikes for me to consider as well, that would be appreciated! I am looking to stay around $2500, NX 12sp is just fine, and around 160/160mm or 170/170mm. Something than climb as well as descent. (I am not good at either.) Okay, last statement: I've read on a forum that the frame sizing is a little small. For reference, I felt right at home on a Large SBC Enduro, and I'm 6 foot tall. Comparing the two on 99spokes, the geo seems pretty similar, but that post said that the Large Capra fits 5'8"" - 5'10"" better. Thoughts? I'll try to find the post and link it up!

I am also open to renting a bike with more travel if it would make my experience that much better.

1181,"Question / Advice needed for potential bike build Hello all, I've a question regarding potentially building a bike from the frame, with parts from another bike.  The first bike I purchased, before I knew anything regarding mountain biking, was a Motobecane 427 HT: 

 [http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/275-650b-bikes/427ht\_27-650b\_mountainbikes.htm](http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/275-650b-bikes/427ht_27-650b_mountainbikes.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

I rode this enough to know I enjoyed the sport, but needed a better bike to feel more comfortable and progress.  This bike FEELS AWFUL to ride.  The frame feels way to short or crunched, I feel way too upright - I essentially feel the opposite of aggressive.  

My current bike is a Calibre Bossnut and I freaking love it.  I'm comfortable - my reach feels perfect - I'm confident on it.  Recently, I rode a different hardtail (not the motobecane), and found it was just different enough for me to want one.  I loved throwing it around, the speed, and the difficulty.  

My question is - Could I buy an appropriately size frame online (also a new handlebar), and install the motobecane parts onto it for a better ride?   I feel like the parts on the motobecane are fine - it's the geometry that is terrible.  Furthermore, if I buy a frame built for 27.5+ tires, would regular 27.5 tires fit on there ok?  

Anyways, I appreciate any responses you guys could throw my way.  I'm still relatively new to mountain biking but it's easily my favorite thing to do now.",0

1193,"2019 Diamondback Line Hi all,

When I was looking at my first bike I really liked the diamondback Line.  I mostly based this decision on Seth on YouTube helping the noob by getting her a Hook.  I figured I could go 1 step ahead of that and be set.  

The biggest let down to me on the purchase when I first got it was the coil fork.  I was 100% certain the SR Suntour xcr was an air fork... it is NOT.

The only other let down I have had was the groupset

Shimano Altus 1x9 groupset set -

This is absolute trash.  I have broken the cage on the derailleur and had to purchase a new one after the first ride.  The gear on it got lodged and bent the cage beyond repair from a 1 gear downshift on a small climb.  

The gearing is too far apart to be useful and the overall range is not adequate for the terrain around here.

I have ordered a used slx m7000 1x11 groupset off Ebay.  Hoping for the best on that!

Since this is my first mountain bike, I cannot give an opinion on how terrible the fork is but it works well for me.  It absorbs the roots on climbs and I can decend rock gardens with minimal effort. 

I have also added a brand-x ascend dropper that a friend is lending me.  


I started this journey at 302lbs and my weigh in this morning was 281lbs.  I have rode this bike just over 200 miles, just under 100 of those miles have been in the woods. 

 I plan on upgrading sooner than later because I simply do not like the feel of the bike.  It feels like I am stretched too far foreward when in the saddle on a climb.  

My future options are:

YT Jeffsy cf pro 29er
Santa Cruz 5010
Stump jumper carbon comp 29er
Stump jumper st 29

Overall, I do not regret the purchase.  It is a solid bike that I have learned a tremendous amount on.  I do not think it is worth the MSRP price though.",0

1200,"Rookie Ride Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking this sub for a few weeks (just added it to my home page, so I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious), and I wanted to say thanks for all the great information! The only thing I knew about bikes was that we had Tuesday trick days on our target BMX bikes when I was 8, and that was two decades and some change ago. Thanks to this sub, I was able to identify some basic needs to avoid a death trap - I know my GT isn’t the best bike on earth, or probably even in my neighborhood, but it’s got everything I need. 

So, first thoughts from my first ride:

1.	It is much more terrifying than YouTube would have you believe
2.	I need to do more cardio
3.	I can see a clear path to obsession


Thanks for all the great info, ride hard everyone!https://i.imgur.com/3v9c8lp.jpg",0
1201,"Motorcycle High Top Sneakers? Hi All,

The other day I went to REI to try on some MTB sneakers. Five tens and Pearl Izumi etc. and I can't say that I am too impressed to be honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially we are looking for stiffer flat sole with grippy rubber. But if we are looking for slightly taller shoes we are left with something like the Five Ten Impact sneakers. How much different are they from high top motorcycle specific sneakers?  


High top moto sneakers will have ankle impact cups, reinforced heel and toe, stiffer and grippy sole.

Anybody tried using motorcycle sneakers instead of MTB specific footwear?

In 2012 I had it fully serviced and then put it back in storage.

Is there a way to sell it and maximise the value? Or just let it go for a few hundred, (if that?)

Hi im new to mountain biking and went on a local trail and everything was fine apart from on the descend when the ground got a bit rough my handle bars were shaking like hell making me having to grip harder to control it in which i did by pressing the palm on my hand harder into bars and then squeezing harder with my fingers.

I was trying to ride with all my weight on the pedals but it wasnt possible for me on rough terrain with the full bike shaking so much.

Could this be down to my fork setup being incorrect? or even wrong technique of digging my palm into the grips to hold on tighter?

My bike is a 2018 Voodoo Bizango and i have the air fork at 85PSI and i weight 85kg i also have tubeless tyres which the front is 30 PSI and rear is 35PSI. Also the lockout wasnt on and the rebound was set to the fastest. 

I wasnt wearing gloves because i am fairly new so wanted to start out with minimal gear and buy more if i like it. Would gloves help a lot in this situation?

Features like rock ladders, rock rolls, wood were all difficult especially if they required some change of direction at the same time. 

Mostly my front tire would lead the way fine but then my back would slide through the corner and I’d lose the ability to control my speed (not talking about going fast to begin with). 

I know grip can’t always be perfect, but where would you start to solve this problem? I’m fairly new to riding so to me it feels like I might just be grabbing the back brake too hard, but it’s hard to get a feel for if it’s that or if it’s time to lower my tire pressure or look for better tires.

1267,"Building a commute wheelset from DT Swiss mtb hubs I have a Canyon Spectral CF 8.0 EX bike, the 2017 model. I cracked both my DT Swiss M1700 Spline Two 30mm 27.5"" wheels 2 years ago on a rocky desert trail. bought a new set (the same model) and has been riding it happily since.

Lately, I find myself commuting to work more and more on the bike and started feeling for my tires and considering building a second set of wheels so I could swap between the two sets when going on the trails or to work. I still have the old wheels; the hubs are in perfect shape and I would think the spokes are fine too. Btw, they are DT competition® straightpull spokes mounted in  3-cross (1:1) pattern (28 spokes per wheel).

I was thinking of getting some light and narrow XC rims (or even gravel?) and match them with some relatively narrow and slick tires. Is rim selection limited by the type of  spokes I'll be using? Current wheels are built with 30mm rims. How narrower should I go? What rims would you recommend?  I run Sram GX complete drivetrain. Would you recommend a different  cassette for this new real wheel?

1268,"Carbon vs aluminum bars? 31.8 vs 35mm? I'm in need of an overhaul on my front end. My process came with Kona branded 35mm aluminum bars and I just get way too mcu feedback through them.

I didn't realize you needed a special pump (this what last year).  I ended up letting all of the top and the bottom.  I used an air pump that went to my car to get some air back in the shock.  So I let it sit for a while, but when I used it I just had the lockout turned on so it wasn't mushy.  I took it to a bike shop today and asked if they could ""fix"" my mistake.  They did something and now the shock is almost bottomed out and it won't rebound any.  They simply said, ""your shock needs to be rebuilt, it's going to cost $200"".  Now, even though it was very squishy, before they put air in and did ""something"".. the rebound was fine in the sense that the fork was fully extended when no weight was on it.  Now it is just bottomed out.  This is a pic.

1299,"Finished my first ride today, it went as I expected https://imgur.com/a/WP3Rgzt

Overall, I had a good time for my first ride. A couple of my observations though:

1. I’m super out of shape. The uphill climb nearly killed me and I walked a lot of it. At one point my heart rate was up around 180 and I could hear my heart beating in my ears, so I pulled over and rested for a good 10 minutes. At one point around half way up I contemplated turning around and just going back down, but I pushed on. I wish I could have rode more of the uphill, but everyone starts somewhere. 

2. The downhill was terrifying, yet exhilarating at the same time. Unbeknownst to me, my riding partners took me down a trail that is blue/black. I went around more of the technical features, but the downhill still had quite a bit of rocks and loose dirt/sand with exposure on one, or both sides at all times. 

3. There were times I didn’t feel super in control of the bike. Maybe it was me fighting the bike, but I just didn’t feel like the tires were gripping the trail. I think I had too much air in the tires, but didn’t have a pressure gauge to check. I also rode the back brake quite a bit especially on the downhill. My riding buddies said that the confidence will grow as I continue to ride with them. 

4. The plus side is, I rode a trail that is at the upper end of the skill range of my group of buddies. Had I known it was blue/black I probably wouldn’t have done it, but I know in my mind I can. 

5. I also crashed twice. Didn’t get any cuts or scrapes, but it did help get over the fear of crashing a bit. 

6. I need to work on proper form for descending. At one point I had my ass really low over my back tire to the point where my tire was rubbing my shorts and nearly pulling them down. 

My ass and legs hurt like no other, so we’ll see how I feel tomorrow. 

All in all, a good first experience.",0

1315,"Elevation Tracking - GPS vs Barometric Altimeter? I recently picked up a Garmin Instinct to track my MTB rides.  It was great and I was really excited until I noticed that my elevation readings were drastically lower than the others  on my same rides.  The same ride on my GPS shows a little more half the elevation gain as everyone else.  The watch uses a barometric altimeter to track elevation changes and it has been on auto mode which changes between altimeter and barometer modes.  After reading up on this, I have changed it to stay on altimeter mode so that it assumes all pressure changes are related to altitude changes, not weather changes. I'm hoping this will improve things for my next ride.

I'm new to this, but can anyone enlighten me on what is most accurate for tracking elevation changes for MTB rides?  From what I've read, I think there is 1) GPS elevation which is like running Strava from your phone. It is an estimate and has a pretty big margin of error and 2) a barometric altimeter which is what I have, but there are the different modes and you have to calibrate often...anything else?

Every time I try to bunny hop the chain shakes hardly and it feels like it is about to fall out (happens when I hit the ground with my rear wheel, of course).
I know that it is something normal for the chain to move a little because of the impact with the ground, but I’ve seen a lot of videos of people bunnyhopping and their chain stays almost still.
Even if it sounds pathetic, I am really concerned about this issue since it shakes like crazy even when I drop from a very low sidewalk border. I don’t know if a loosened chain can be a thing.

1368,"Ordered a new bike from ChainReaction, and it arrived damaged. Looking for some advice Got my first bike ever new from ChainReaction, and it came with a sizeable chip on the frame (on a suspension link).  There was no damage to the box where the chip is, so my guess is they let it out of the shop like that to be shipped. I'm in the US, which makes this a bit more complicated. Another concern would be that if it was hit hard enough to make a chip like that, there may be some damage to the suspension link. 

I'd accept a return but I'm hesitant for 2 reasons: 

1. I got the bike on clearance. It was $1283 after shipping (Marin Rift Zone 2 retails for $1959) 

2.  The bike is not in stock anymore in my size, and there is nothing similar for a price like this. 

While it may not be a big deal, I definitely wouldn't buy a bike from a shop like this, so it also seems like they shouldn't have shipped it out. They've offered store credit ($40), and they've also offered to return it for a refund, but neither option seems ideal as I definitely wouldn't have accepted the bike for $40 off.  

What's the bare minimum I should accept from them at this point? Any comments about the situation would be appreciated!

Yesterday a different friend and I did this on five small to medium rollers on the trail we were at. And it really changed the game and helped us progress. Then we went back to the beginning of the trail and linked all these together. Another useful tip with this that he provided is rolling up to the edge of whatever you are going off of and stop to look. It allows some of the fear and anxiety to subside before you back up and try it. We also found that some speed helped a lot. It makes the roll over easier on bumps.

1394,"Gyro or Straight Cable I just got my first dirt jumper yesterday and I wanted to be able to do bar spins and tailwhips once I get good enough, but didn't know if I should get a gyro or a long brake hose.

When I do bar spins, I spin the bars clockwise, but I also spin the bike clockwise for tailwhips. So, if I wrap a long brake hose around the steerer tube for barspins, it only works for bar spins, and the cable gets more tangled when I do tailwhips. It wraps the cable the wrong way and makes it tighter. I'd rather not not wrap the cable around the steerer tube and have a huge 3 foot section of the cable out in front of my bike so I can do both. Also, if I wrap my current normal sized cable around twice, which is just barely possible with a little bit of slack, it pulls on the calipers a little bit, making the lever super tight. If I had a much longer cable, would this not happen?

But, gyros aren't without their faults either. From what I've read, gyros are quite hard to set up, don't have as much braking power, and are heavier. I don't care much about weight, but I already don't have much braking power with a mechanical brake instead of hydraulic (I don't actually know if this makes a difference but I thought I'd say it just in case.), a small disk, and a small brake. Although, some people have said that they have just as much braking power when dialed in correctly, but people usually respond by saying that they are very hard to set up well enough, and it's not worth the time.

Does anyone have any suggestions/solutions? 

TL;DR I want to do tailwhips and bar spins on my dj bike, but an extra long brake cable doesn't seem like it'll work, and I've heard some bad things about gyros.

Edit: I think the bike/bars would spin the correct way if I moved my brake to the other side. I live in 'Merica, so my brake is on the right side of the bars, but I mainly mountain bike so it shouldn't be too much of a problem I hope. I still don't know about the brake tihjtening tho.",0
1395,"Riding tip: If you recently bought a long, low, and slack full suspension coming from an older hard tail, you may need to work on your ratcheting technique. This Spring I went from a hard tail where I hardly ever had pedal and crank strikes to a long, low, and slack full suspension and immediately started having problems with crank and pedal strikes. 

What I discovered is that I wasn't using the ratcheting technique very much at all because on my hard tail I didn't really need to, so that was my habit. On this new bike I have to much more aggressively make use of this technique to get over features than ever before. Once I figured this out it has made my riding much more enjoyable and to also get me through lines that would otherwise stop me before.

The stem is too wide to fit the bolt pattern on the crown.  So my question is: can I put a newer upper crown (with a wider bolt pattern) on an older suspension so that my new direct mount stem fits? Or can I put a regular stem that clamps on the steer tube? Does anybody run a regular stem on dual crown forks?

I forgot how addicting and how much fun it is. When we started looking at bikes my wife didn’t want to spend much because she didn’t know how much we would ride. She’s already talking about upgrading and making some trips specifically to go ride and explore new places. We’ve made it a point to come home almost every day and ride even if it’s just a little bit.

I am just getting back into biking again after 15 years and won't be doing anything crazy at all, green trails and blue trails for me, I turn 55 this year and don't feel like any emergency room visits.

The new crank is using the new DUB standard and decided to go all in and get a complete SRAM GX EAGLE 12 groupset. I am keeping the brakes as they are fine, but am changing the rotors to Shimano Ice-Tek ones with sintered pads.

I have only been on a few trails so far this year as I need to rebuild my stamina and strength back up again, but my condo has an unreal fitness room with everything you could ever really want.

OK, so my question is, am I going to notice a difference going from 175mm to 170mm, but also take into account that I am also going from 1x10 to 1x12.

On one trail I did catch a root with one of my pedals, so I am wondering if going to 170mm might actually be a good thing.

1439,"Bike upgrades...? Hello, I recently got into mountain biking and I'm freaking loving it! I've been shredding trails and hitting some dirt jumps at local bike parks with my $599 GT Aggressor Comp 2018 from SportChek which I got on a deal for $399 ;\] I've been a skier for well over 10 years and my park skills are decent so I enjoy dirt jumping a lot, as well as shredding flow trails. 

I'm looking to invest a little more into this newly found hobby and upgrade my bike. (New and better bike would be nice but I've only just got this bike and you know... money lol) Currently I have in mind swapping out the shatty nylon pedals that have short and brittle nylon pins, the stem because my stems are a bit long for my style of riding, and most importantly, the feckin fork.

The only question is, is it worth upgrading a bike of this range and if so, would it be fine to upgrade to any kind of fork of any length of travel? (Mine is a 80mm spring suspension, so like is it possible to upgrade to a 120mm air suspension?)

1470,"Don't be like me, don't talk about what you don't know about when it comes to bikes, especially when you've never tried the thing you're talking smack about.  Two months ago I was talking smack on hardcore hardtails...

&gt;Personally  I don't get 140mm + travel hardtails. As the fork compresses through  it's travel, the whole bike pivots around the rear axle and the head  tube angles steepens a good amount. Basically with the geometry changing  that much on compression, it feels weird.  
&gt;  
&gt;Super  slack is not necessarily needed, try not to get caught up in numbers  and just try bikes out to see what feels better. Being that you're  inexperienced, I'd just get one in your budget with the best bang for  your buck components to just start there. You're not going to notice 1  or 2 degrees of head tube angles differences right now. Especially if  the steepest one is 66, that still feels pretty slack and good.

What I didn't say was that I was talking out of my ass, never ridden a 140+ hardtail or a super slack one. Then I actually looked at the bike I was talking smack on, the Ragley Mmmbop, and it looked so damn cool, I knew I had to have it. I bought a frame, built it up and took it for its first ride today, and it was amazing, the thing is super fun!

 I can't count how many times I've heard people talk down on 29ers or 26ers or 650b's or Lefty's or X or Y or really anything cycling related that can be argued over. Then you ask them if they've ever tried it and get nothing but guffawing like, ""Why would I try it, I think its dumb!"" 

This ended more rant-y than I wanted but I guess what I'm trying to say is that its always worth it to try that new X, Y, or Z thing before immediately talking smack and dismissing it.",0

1477,"First MTB Ride Today (...on the road) Hey Gang -

So, I'm an old(er) guy - mid 30's, reasonably athletic, like to stay in shape and eat well(ish). Have to be able to chase my kids around. That kind of thing. That said, I'm pretty sure a mountain bike tried to kill me today. I have been wanting to run a triathlon for a few years now. And, because I'm OCD about it, I want to scale into it - sprint first, then olympic, etc. etc. But, my first race is going to be a trail sprint - so it's Mountain Bike territory. Not going to lie, I'm excited.

Anyway, so the neighborhood I live in has a series of respectable hills split between a handful of streets. So, I thought I'd warm up on my flat street, climb some hills, recover on the downslope. Easy day. Well, first of all that was a seriously dumb thing to think. Wow. Hills suck.

That does bring me to a newbie question, though. The bike that I've borrowed from a friend is a Trek Marlin 6 (seat is a little big and a little low, but I'll fix that later) and I spent some time today learning the gearing (PS - is it normal for MTB bikes not to have kickstands?) and trying to figure out what rings I'd use on downhill, uphill, flat, out of saddle - etc. Here's my question; knowing that I have a lot of variety in my back derailleur, why would I ever come off my largest front ring? It just seems like something I wouldn't worry about. Smaller gears going up, bigger gears going down, find a sweet spot on the flats - but only worry about one hand. Is this a common newbie misconception? Someone educate me.

well, i have the bike and rode it around for a bit and i guess i'm not used to the geometry at all coming from Nishiki (it has more aggressive geometry and has full suspension - Marin is hardtail). it feels a bit too big and somewhat clumsy, i'm sure i'll get used to it, but that's just my initial observation.

Having her demo bikes isn't really an option since she has no idea what she wants and is leaning on me to get her a good starter bike.

My concerns with 29ers are that they're a little heavier and harder to navigate in the tight stuff. She's 5'9"", and I think a 29 would be alright since she'll be more XC than Enduro oriented anyways. Anyone have good experiences starting on a 29er?

1588,"2019 Norco Fluid 2 HT review/thoughts Just got this bike. First thoughts were that the paint is so much sexier in person it's almost ridiculous. The matte green and flat black color scheme is so dope. 

The bike itself handles like an endurance bike. Most logs that I had to exert effort to clear on my old bike are barely even a bump now. I don't even feel some of the stuff that stopped me when I ride over it now. 

The short chainstay and medium reach contribute to the stable, yet snappy feel of the Fluid. It lends itself to some really good wheelies and manuals, but is stable enough in the corners. 

What really makes it fun is the combination of 2.8 tires and extremely aggressive geometry. Going around a corner is always different, but in a nice way, e.g. playful and fun with just enough sketch factor to make it rad as hell. 

Overall, this bike is a steal for the price I paid. I would expect other bikes in this category to cost around $1400, but I got mine for $1100 including the shipping from Canada to my LBS (who set it up for me and did a great job).

1591,"Concerning protection. I think I need more than helmet, safety glasses and gloves....contemplating back protection and better hand protection etc So this is my second season of mtb’ing. Been riding bicycles most of my life but it’s never been competitive or for sports. Just bmx for fun as kid and then all kinds of bikes for transportation since then.

I have started to use my mtb to go for a hike instead of using the legs. This has taken me weird places with my bike and I have to carry or push the bike at least 30-50% of the way. 

The terrain has also seen me taken a few falls. It’s standstill falls almost so nothing really dangerous. But I have started to wonder about protection. 

I have 3 bruises on my chest from hitting the bar end. I have pain in my hand from the crashes too. 

Otherwise I feel amazingly good. It’s special to wade through swamps with my bike and get covered in mud. I feel a little bit like I felt like in the army. And I miss it hehe. 

But. 

Are there any mtb gloves that will actually help in a fall? Something more than the full finger leader mtb gloves I already have. Will padding actually help? 

And back protection. I have been looking at some class 1 but I dunno. I should probably go for class 2 if I decide to use back protection. 

I have already decided that I will start to use some good knee pads. At least something 3DO foam thick thing. And not the thin XC knee slides I have now. 

I was thinking maybe one of those t-shirt protection suits? And maybe some underwear with a little bit of padding. 

It’s probably gonna cost me 1000 dollars all together but I guess I will have good use of it. 

I am 46 years old. It’s getting silly to get small hurts every time I am out pretending to be a kid again.

Edit: thank you all for great advice.

1648,"Pinch flats galore. Hey there. I'm an electric MTB rider in the city.
Have perms from my local PD to do the speed limit upto 80kmh.

That being said, I live in Northern Ontario where the roads are terrible. I've gotten. 12 (THAT'S RIGHT TWELVE) pinch flats in the past 3 months with the condition of my roads.

I'm riding a 26""x2.125 that was originally a 26""x1.75
Widening helped a bit but not much. The last 3 flats I inflated to 60psi (sidewall says 35-40psi). 
I'm wondering, since I'm a heavier rider (270lbs) and my bike is also on the heavy side (90lbs with batteries), what pressure would be safe for my rear tire?

My last pinch flat was going over a set of train tracks that were freshly paved less than 2 weeks ago only doing 25kmh, for the most part I'm careful of potholes and bumps, but I can't really slow down much more than that for tracks due to the flow of traffic and since I'm already cruising at around 50-60kmh it causes hella brake fade. So I gave up temporarily until I can find a solution. 

I know that lower pressure increases comfort, but at the speeds I reach (2500w@52v, I've maxed it at 95kmh) comfort is right out the door.

Tl;Dr 400lb combined bike/rider weight what max can I fill my tires to to avoid pinch flats, without considering comfort.

PS yes I've considered tubeless but my rim isn't compatible and I am having a hella time trying to find a stop-a-flat (solid tube) in 26x1.75. I ordered a 26x2.125 and it was too big to seat in my rim so I returned it.

Edit: Forgot to mention, tread is a kenda k53 comfort. Perhaps I need a different tread?",0
1649,"Did I buy too much bike? 2019 Canyon Spectral 7.0 CF Hi everyone - I just purchased a 2019 Canyon Spectral 7.0 CF  (previously rode a 2012 Specialized Epic Expert Carbon).  I've been thinking about buying a Canyon Spectral for a year as it was very well reviewed, excellent quality and the value is outstanding. I needed more suspension travel than the 100/100 on the Epic Expert (the Spectral is 160 front/150 rear - quite an increase!) After riding it several times I'm wondering if I have ""too much bike"" for where I usually ride.  Typically these are moderate trails (blue) with some black diamond areas in the Charlotte, NC area.  However about once or twice a month I'm hitting some much more difficult trails in North Carolina: DuPont State Park, Bent Creek, Uwharrie, etc.  

I realize this is a much different type of bike (XC vs. Trail) and I need to get my suspension and adjustments dialed-in more as I ride it.  Any input/advice would be greatly appreciated.  I have until July 15, 2019 to return the bike to Canyon if I'm not happy with it. Thank you!!!",0

When I descend on my Fuse I'm usually knees bent seat down and basically over the very back of the seat, but still above it. I road a medium RM Instinct today, which RM says is at the end of my Height 5'10''-5'11'' and I can get a good deal on it gently used, but I  just felt when descending with arms outstretched I was completely behind the seat. When I look at the difference of the sizing between medium and large for the RM Instinct on 99 spokes I'm seeing about an inch in top tube length, both of which are shorter than the Fuse. So my question is,  is this geometry just going to put you a bit   closer to over the pedals where you feel a bit more vulnerable to going over the handle bars or is the medium too small for me? I'm just having a hard time believing slightly less than an inch can make that big of a difference, but perhaps it does. Unfortunately I don't have the opportunity to test a large to compare. It's a local  used seller for the medium and no LBS' carry RM. Should I pass, or do the FS's with that geometry just tend to have you a bit closer to the bars because I'm noticing the seat tube angle is 1.5 degrees higher than my Fuse regardless of the size.",0

I’m going to be in Bend in 2 ish weeks for the Oregon 12/24. I haven’t ridden in Bend before (coming down from Bellingham), although I have ridden east of the Cascades in WA. 

I’m wondering about my tire choice and hoping to get some input from folks who have ridden there. 

Current setup: Bontrager XR3 (new pattern) front and rear. I put these on about a month ago and I’m super happy with the grip and rolling resistance. My plan was to keep this setup for race day. 

But- 
Two concerns- 1. How sandy does Bend get in mid-July? It’s dry up in Bellingham right now but I’m worried that the XR3 doesn’t have enough knob to dig in if it’s deep moon dust. 

2. How sharp are the rocks? I’m digging the lighter casing, especially for high mileage days, but potentially worried if there are super sharp rocks especially as my line choice gets sloppier later in the day. 

I have a 2.3 minion, 2.3 butcher, and 2.35 magic mary in the shed that I could swap.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading a lot of negative posts with regards to buying consumer direct bikes and their respective customer service so I wanted to share my own experience with YT Industries, which was quite smooth.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a Jeffsy 29 CF Pro on 6/23 and the bike arrived at my door three days later. Unfortunately, a large chunk of the idler pulley broke off - not sure where/when it snapped but that's how it was delivered to me - see pictures below. I'm suspicious this passed QA as it was since the rear derailleur was neatly wrapped in foam and I didn't see the missing piece of the pulley in the box that bike came in.  I filed a warranty claim with YT and when I called them up the next day they just sent me a new derailleur, no questions asked. I was expecting them to ship me just a new set of pulleys so I was pleasantly surprised by their response. Will update once I get the new derailleur installed.

The bike is a 2016 Process 111 with a Monarch RT and the shock runs under the top tube.

1712,"Trail etiquette when wanting to pass Was riding last night and the trail was hopping which is always fun to see. Caught up to this kid (maybe 8 or 9 years old) who was riding alone. I was going faster than him and after chilling and riding behind him for a while I asked to pass, at which point he sped up and kept looking behind him. He did this for about a mile and a half where he would slow down, look behind at me, and try to sprint away instead of letting me pass. Eventually there was a part of the trail that forked off and when he went right for the shorter loop, I went left so I could gain some space over the longer loop. Didn't run into him again.

When I learned to trail ride the person I went with was like ""yeah, just be cognizant that there are going to be people that are faster than you and you may need to pull over to let them by or if there is room just scoot over tight to the edge of the trail so they can ride by"" I know that it is not a race and maybe the kid was just having a good time trying to race me or whatever but I'm trying to get faster and improve my conditioning and I went out wanting to ride pretty hard and didn't really intend to do an easy spin for that long.

1-is asking to pass the right way to pass people? Is it better to just say ""I'm passing"" and keep saying it until you can safely pass them? 

2-in this situation when you are encountering what appears to be a new-ish rider, is it appropriate to say ""hey dude, when people are faster than you, you need to let them by. It's common courtesy and it's safer than you pushing yourself to try to keep ahead of me"" 

Most adults on my local trails are really good about this stuff; if I'm getting passed, I let people by and they do the same for me. Really the only time I've gotten stuck behind someone who refused to let me pass was during a race and it was super annoying because every time there was an opportunity to go around the dude he would speed up when I started going through the thick grass to go around him but that was a race. I don't want to discourage someone from riding by lecturing them or whatever but also, if this kid develops a passion for MTB I don't want to run into him on the trails for years and be like ""great, this guy who never lets people pass is back"".",0

1728,"Advantages and drawbacks to running tubes in a fatbike, and in a standard bike? (besides the obvious) I realize the obvious advantages to going tubeless - pinch flat protection and better traction, ability to run lower PSI, and especially on a fat bike lower rolling resistance.

As someone who likes to lean the bike and corner hard, I'm always a little worried about sidewall support, which I understand might be a legitimate advantage to running tubes.  Am I correct here?  Will running tubes let me corner harder (on both a fat bike and a standard 27.5 or 29er?) without worries of sidewall collapse compared to tubeless?

My other question is in regards to the lowest pressures you can run with tubes on a fatbike.  My local trail does grooming in the winter and they ask that riders lower their pressure to about 4PSI or less to prevent damage to the groomed snow surface.  Is running at such low pressure with tubes an issue?  The snow should be softer, smoother, and slower than the surface underneath, so I suspect that this will lower the chance of pinch flats.  However, I haven't tried it yet!  I understand that the tubes *will* slow me down, but I don't really care about that very much...I just want to know if it will work without any obvious problems.",0

I've demoed few 29ers and a Canyon Spectral CF 7 (2019, L size). Didn't like 29 wheels - felt too big as I currently ride 26 wheels. Maybe I get used to them? Also the Spectral is praised everywhere, but when I rode it - it felt slightly too high when pedaling. Jeffsy 27 AL is sold out (was the first one I looked at), the 29er AL has old geo (reach 445 in L seemed short). I'm from Europe, so Diamondback bikes for example are not available to me - seen positive stuff about those. My budget currently is around 2500-3000 euro.

&amp;#x200B;

These are my contenders (RIPMO is pricier than my budget though) - I'm 183cm tall:

== 27.5 wheels ==

Santa Cruz 5010 in L

Whyte T-130 SR in M

JEFFSY 27 CF COMP in L

&amp;#x200B;

== 29 wheels ==

IBIS RIPMO in L (around 4k euro for NX build)

CAPRA 29 AL in L

COMMENCAL AM/TR 29 in L (the essential one is 3200 euro)

JEFFSY 29 CF COMP in L (around 3k)

&amp;#x200B;

I ride trails and freeride/downhile (not the hardest stuff, intermediate at the moment). I started out few months ago. I appreciate any kind of input from riders, as currently I'm kinda stuck in the decision process, so even alternatives would be great. I was leaning towards the 5010, but the lowest alu spec is not available (only frame) - so maybe some similarly ""feeling"" bike?

1750,"Can't screw new pedal or stock pedal back on, do I need to get a new crank arm? How do I know which size crank arm to get, does it have to be the same brand as the over side? So I recently bought new pedals, the right side was easy to put on the new pedal but the other side it was harder to get the pedal off and I failed to get the new pedal on. I couldn't screw the original stock pedal back on either so I'm assuming the thread on the crank arm is stripped. So now I'm basically without a bike to ride. Should I take it to my local bike shop and see if they can fix it without ordering a new crank arm? I googled it and I can't find a replacement of the same left crank arm, so does that mean I have to buy both a new crank arm left and right so that they're matching?",0

1754,"Foot position (flats) Hey guys. 
Newer rider. Learning lots. This sub has been awesome. 

I seem to encounter trouble getting foot position where I want it on the top of shorter runs. Super hard to adjust mid ride as you’re really trying to keep speed up and not fiddle with foot placement. Feels like it makes it tough to place weight where I want it on berms and take offs. 

Am I overthinking this? I’m on zero danger of slipping off the pedals (race face pedals and Mavic flats). Just feels super awkward, maybe it’s just something I need to ignore/embrace.

Do you ride feet parallel to frame? Toes slightly in? Midfoot? Ball of foot?

Feel free to tell me to kick rocks and direct me to a skills with Phil/GBMN video. I’m certain this question gets asked on a yearly basis around here.",0

The Growler 40 is 27+ bike and I heard the sales person say when I first got it that if I wanted to change the chainring, I would need an offset one to be compatible with my bike.

So does that mean that I would need the Sram GX Eagle Boost crankset? Or is the regular crankset suitable? 

And I have no clue what DUB BB I would need as well.

I have looked high and low trying to determine what sort of BB I have currently, BSA, BB30, etc, etc.
But no luck at all aside from someone saying that it was threaded. 

I really wish I could find a service manual for the bike, but again, no where to be found. 

Anyone here have some advice for me on what version I need to go with?

1767,"Stumpy vs “modern” geo bikes I’m trying to decided between a Spec Stumpy Expert 29 and a Commencal Meta TR 29. I like the Stumpy but wonder if I’ll be missing out on a steeper STA and a slightly slacker HTA, like the Meta, SB, Ripmo, etc. I appreciate any advice or experience!

[Stumpjumper Expert 29](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/mens-stumpjumper-expert-29/p/154958)  (Large, $3600, family discount)

Pros: LBS warranty and support. Already test ridden (liked it). Build is great. Carbon.

Concerns: Geometry isn’t quite that “modern”- HTA could be steeper. 

[Meta TR 29](https://www.commencalusa.com/Mobile/meta-trail-29-essential-fox-brushed-2019-c2x26749842)  (Medium, $ varies on build)

Pros: Geometry seem great. Well reviewed.

Concerns: Geo seems great with 130mm travel in the back and a larger fork, but most of the reviews state that this is a heavy, burly bike made for going downhill- which is cool, but seems to go against the versatility of the 130mm frame. Tires aren’t very good and dropper is only 125mm on Medium. Complaints about heel rub from the wide chainstay.

The rear is actually quite nice with decent modulation and plenty of power, but the front was a different story. No mush in the pull like there was air in the lines, but the thing just had no power. Cleaned the rotors, bedded them, etc - no change it just was crummy. 

So after reading lots of great reviews I bought an XT for up front, but kept the Hayes 180 rotor as I figured I didn't really need a Shimano disc. Well, I ran some heat cycles on it to bed the pads in and it's just as bad as the Hayes... Not mushy, just no power. I've ridden XT brakes before and I know how much grab they can have... Is this because I'm not using a Shimano disc? Should it really matter that much? Any ideas?

1840,"Knee pads for 24"" thighs? Searched and most posts talking about knee pads for us with big legs are useless. Lots of ""I have keg legs too....or my legs are like tree trunks....I have huge legs....blah blah blah"". All these comments are useless without some context such as measurements. You might think you have big legs but in fact they are pretty normal but your buddy has 15"" thighs so you see your normal 18-20"" thigh as being huge and they are not. So saying that an XL brand X model Y knee pad fits well is bunk because when I look at the sizing chart it shows measurements for someone with normal size, not big legs.

Anyways...I have legs with the following measurements...

Calf = 19""

Knee = 17""

Thigh 2"" above knee = 22""

4"" above knee = 24""

6"" above knee = 26""

I noticed that I was close to pinch flat 3 times on the trial before it finally puncture when I entered a little stream at full speed. 

So I swapped the tube today and I got a bike shop to set the tyre for me with their pressure pump. 

I put back the wheel the way I saw fit. I have true-axel or whatever it’s called and tbh I don’t really know what I was doing but I think I made it. It seems to sit solid. 

There is absolutely no rubbing of the disk breaks so I assumed the rim was put in perfectly. 

But there is quite the wobble when riding. 

So is it possible the rim came untrue when I got my pinch flat? Or is it something off with the way I put the wheel back on? Is it possible to not put it in correct when one has tru-axle?

Or did I actually destroy the rim when I got my pinch flat? There are no dents on the rim or anything.

1874,"Advice - Reentry to the Sport Good morning!

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about 10 years since I have done any mountain biking, but I am looking to get back into the sport. My wife and I have been getting back into bikes for exercises, and I am fortunate enough to have a system of singletrack trails within riding distance of my home, only a few tenths of a mile away.

&amp;#x200B;

Presently, I am riding about a 10 year old Specialized Rockhopper Comp with a Rockshox Tora and Avid mechanical disc brakes. It is not a bad bike, but I think it is way too big for me. I recall the guy at the shop encouraging me to go for a larger sized frame. I am 5'11"" and it is a 21"" frame, which I believe is an XL. The bike is alright for riding, but it seems almost impossible to manuever at any speed around tight turns. I think I am missing out on the mountain bike experience by having a poorly sized bike, plus the technology and components are dated.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I started to research bikes. I am torn between a hardtail and full suspension bike. 10 years ago, full suspension bikes were not as affordable as they are today, at least something that was serviceable. I really like the lineup for Diamondback, given I can get the bike shipped directly to my house. Like I said, my prior experience with shops was not great, and I did not like the pressure to buy something that was in stock, which I feel is why I was pushed into the larger frame with the Rockhopper.  I want the bike for riding Pennsylvania trails, not much in terms of hardcore downhill. I really like flowing track rather than anything too technical, at least in this stage of my experience. Also, it would be nice for the bike to be serviceable for rail to trails and casual family riding, given my wife is riding (road mainly) and we purchased a trailer for our kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that, I have been leaning toward a Diamondback Sync'R, Specialized Fuse 27.5, and Diamondback Atroz 3. For the price range, $1,200 to $1,400, these bikes seem to be well spec'd. I am a little bummed the Diamondbacks do not have dropper posts, but I suppose that can be an update. The pros and cons and balancing of the components is what overwhelms me. I really don't understand the nuance in each fork, all come with solo air Rockshox designs, which seems good for me. But, is there a big difference in these? I think the Sync'R and Atroz have the better fork, the Recon RL versus the Fuse with the Judy TK Silver. I am leaning toward the Diamondbacks, but am not sure if I would be better suited with a hardtail versus full suspension. I understand there are some advantages of the hardtail, but it sounds as though the primary issues in the past with full suspension, a lack of efficiency, have been worked out for the most part. I feel like the Atroz may be a better choice, and I may be regretting the hardtail if I go with it.

Alright, so I'm getting kind of fed up with my Trek Marlin 6, I bought it as a starter bike ($680~) because I wasn't sure I was going to ride as much as I am. So fast forward and I'm riding trails and getting really into it. I was wanting to go to a single chain ring. Spent $100 at a bike shop for a chain ring, chain, and bolts, only to find out that my crank arms have plastic crap to make it look like it's a removable chain ring but it's not. So I took the stuff back. I'm all for supporting my local shops, but I ordered the stuff on amazon to get the chain ring I wanted (raceface) because the shops didn't have it. I ordered SRAM crank arms, Chester raceface pedals, bolts, and a nice durable chain. So today I get home, and the spindle length is 127.5 mm,  instead of whatever the standard is. So I have to order a $60 adapter kit that comes with new crank arms to actually get this to work. Looked around and only Trek is using this weird size, and only on their entry level bikes. Are they putting these parts on just to make it harder to upgrade the bikes or what?! Only thing that makes sense to me. I want to just buy a new bike but I love the frame, and it's my first nice bike. I'm gonna go through with the upgrade but damn if I'm not finding out this bike really wasn't worth the money.",0

I picked up a [cheap entry level bike](http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/fsx_1.htm) with my tax return this year, and so far have replaced the handlebars with wider ones, wider tires with more tread, added a shorter stem and new pedals. 

I havn't had a whole lot of free time to go out and ride too much yet, but I have been out to my local trail (5-6 mi. long) probably about 6 times now, and have traveled a town over twice now for a trail over there. Just recently my 2nd time at the trail a town over my chain ended up breaking around 2 miles into an 8 mile long trail, leaving me to walk the 2 miles back to my parked car. Since then I have a new, nicer quality chain on the way.

Reason for my title is so far the biggest issue I have had with my bike is the chain skipping/slipping. This really sucks when I am  coming up to a decent climb and my chain slips, therefore causing me to lost some if not all of my momentum. Obviously with my bike of choice it did not come with a derailleur that has the luxury of a clutch included with it. So I am wondering if there are any tips you guys have to help me with this problem? Ive heard of maybe removing a few chain links, but im not too sure if that is actually a good solution.",0

1882,"Drained some oil out of the damper side of my Fox Float 32 O/B to solve the suspected issue of an overfilled damper. Need some help with notchy feel at a specific point of the forks travel after closing everything back up Following the Fox guide, I removed the compression and rebound adjusters from the top of my fork, while leaving the lower legs on. I gently pulled the damper further out of the fork until it stopped (cannot be completely removed because it was still screwed in through the lower legs), and then compressed the fork to push oil to the top. Using a syringe, I drained the oil out until the fork could reach full travel without oil spilling out the top. I put the top cap back on without the rebound and lockout to test the forks function. It feels smooth until about 30% in, where it seems to hit a notch, and it requires some extra force to break through to the rest of the travel, which once again feels smooth. 

I'm not sure what could cause this as there is still plenty of oil in the damper side and I didn't mess with the spring side. Initially, I thought it was possible that the fork was locked, but it doesn't make sense since when this fork is locked, there is only a few mm of movement allowed, not the ~50mm that it travels before hitting the ""stop"". I rode around and cycled the fork at my normal PSI in an attempt to fix the issue, but it's still not any better.

1885,"New fatbike mechanical issues Hey

I just bought a new Cube Nutrail fatbike 10 days ago and it has some issues. It's a 2x10 speed bike and the first issue I noticed was that on higher gears, like 15-20 the chain would start making noise(clicking) at the front derailleur. I don't remember my old regular 27-speed MTB ever doing that from 1-27 gearshifts.

I took it back to the shop and the bike tech told me it's fixed. I tried it and it was. But just for testing purposes I tried gears from 1-10 and now they were clicking(chain was making contact?) instead, more noticeably than the higher gears.
I rode back and told him about it and he said that's normal? I either choose to have the clicking/chain dragging on the lower gears or the higher gears, I can't have it without. Something about the chain being tilted with 1 setting or the other. Honestly it made no sense to me since when I rode bikes before, none of them had this issue. But I took him at his word and rode home.

2 days later after some light trail riding and commuting to work on my way home the feeling in the pedals suddenly changed and it was making this horrible, loud rumbling noise like inside the crankarm and your feet could feel the wobble/wiggle inside from the pedals. And it was clicking on higher gears again. I was scared to go fast since I thought I would crash, seemed like the crank would just fall off at any second.

Any advice you guys could offer would be appreciated. Is what the bike tech said is true? I feel like I paid ~2000EUR/2200USD for defective bike/bad assembly job. For that money the bike shouldn't be making any noise, rumble, clicking, right?",0

It seemed in good shape, the LBS where I bought it checked it out and gave it a thumbs up, said there were no red flags. So I've been riding it for about a month, and recently noticed oil on my fork along with damaged seals. After taking it for service, my LBS recommended a fork rebuild and called Fox to see about sending it in, but Fox can't rebuild the fork because they don't make the parts for a fork that old.

A little bit more about my riding style. I ride the blue trails at Northstar and maybe want to start hitting the easier blacks soon, but not necessarily this season. I also ride All Mountain trails in the Reno / Tahoe area. I don't jump or do big drops, but do like to ride the downhills as fast as I can and push my comfort zone as I progress. My current goals are to stay in the saddle, try to go faster downhill, and have fun.

And FYI, I don't really want to invest much more $ into this bike, it was supposed to be a starter bike for this season to ride at Northstar and see how much I liked DH. I was already planning on getting a nicer bike next season or the following. I was ok spending up to $200 on the rebuild, but now that's not an option.

So, I'd like to know:

1) Is this a critical issue red flag kind of problem? What would happen if I kept riding this season on the current fork without a rebuild? A potential catastrophic injury, or just worse handling / performance over time? It still feels ok to me, not sticky, no strange noises, not bottoming out as far as I can tell, etc.

2) Should I forget about the bike, accept the sunken cost, and ride my old hardtail at Northstar until I can afford a new bike next year? Buying a 7-year-old bike at that price, I always knew this was a risk.

3) Should I just get a new fork? If I can spend less than $500 for the parts and installation, and keep my overall costs under $1000, I would still consider doing this, but would rather put that $ toward a new bike. Any recommendations?

Also FYI, I'm fairly new to the mtb scene and don't have much technical knowledge yet, so I appreciate any advice!

TL;DR Would I be ok riding my fork into the ground this season without a rebuild, and save up for a better bike next year?",0

Was riding my usual trail and just sending it when I came around a corner hot and almost ran directly into a mama moose and her baby. I knew I was in a bad spot so I threw the bike down and just started running up the hill next to the trail yelling for my buddies to stop where they were behind me. I caught up to them and explained to them what happened. We agreed to stay in a group and make lots of noise as we move back to where I had left my bike. We got to my bike and it seemed the moose had left so we cautiously kept walking down the trail. About 2 min later we hear then see the mother moose coming up the trail towards us pretty fast. We ditch our bikes and all 3 of us run up the hill and put some space between her and us. We hang out for 10 maybe 15 min just hoping she moves along. We decide it's clear and head down to pick up the bikes. Get to the bikes and were all a little winded and wary but no moose, so were feeling good. I hop on the bike first and start riding. I did not get more than 50 feet from the other riders when I heard a sound I never want to hear again. The mother was full tilt rushing at me from my right side out of the shadows. Apparently her issue was just with me because she completely ignored my buddies who were just getting on their bikes and kept gunning on a collision course for me. I start pedaling like my life depends on it cuz it probably did but as I looked into her eyes I could she was gaining on me. I launched off the bike into a full sprint of my own back uphill just trying to put some trees between me and her. I somehow got behind a boulder and broke line of sight and was able to get back to my riding buddies. I really hadn't lost her tho and right then she came back into view. I ran one way and one buddy followed the other I guess seeing his moment to potentially not die hopped on his bike and blasts past her as shes still coming after me. Fun. We run completely exhausted now uphill further trying to put anything we can (trees, boulders, bushes, ditches) between her and us. After a couple minutes (that felt way too long) she lost interest in pursuing as she must have decided her baby was safe now. We wait 30 min this time then I walk back down and collect the bikes as my buddy who stayed with me was in no shape to run from the moose again if need be. Fortunately she had moved on and I was able to retrieve both bikes and we rode out. 

TL:DR Stay safe on the trail cuz you never know what's around the corner.

Edit to add this except about the proper way to deal with a charging moose.

""An aggressive, confrontational moose is trying to do one thing: drive you off. So if a moose approaches you, back away. If it charges, RUN! Do not stand your ground. If possible, place a tree or other nearby object between you and the moose as you retreat. Once the moose has driven you far enough away, it will leave you alone. If the moose does make contact, it typically strikes first with its front hooves, using its rear legs occasionally in a prolonged assault. If a moose knocks you down, continue your efforts to escape. Sustained assaults are rare, however, and the odds of a fatal attack are extremely low.""",0

Sure enough, the uphill has been the hardest part, I don't quite have the stamina to just keep pushing and pushing. People are riding up like it's no problem, chatting away, not breaking a sweat.

I'm riding 3-4 days a week. So far it's been 1-2 hours max so I'm not killing myself on the uphill, but looking to do longer days and keep that blood flowing.

I know I will get there one day, but any tips on getting there faster?

How long for the body to start picking up the pace and getting used to the 30 minute uphill climbs?

Was thinking about riding the bike at the gym more, at a harder pace for the days I don't make it out.

UPDATED: Went for my longest ride so far after this post, but I didn't really have a chance to read it before hand. It was a pretty solid uphill all on a gravel road, not on a trail climb. This was much easier than the small 1 kilometerI did on my first day mountain biking 13 days ago. I almost died then.

Pacing was by far the biggest part of it, keeping in a nice easy gear.

1941,"Used FS or New HT for beginner? Been going back and forth between looking at FS or HT bikes. I'm a beginner. I've been riding my local trail which is pretty technical with a lot of rocks/boulders and roots. Really have to find a good line through the rocks a lot of the time. I don't have much skill but I've been getting a lot better at climbing through rocks and stuff. My current bike just really isn't cutting it though. It's a 2015 Giant Revel 29 that probably cost $600 brand new. It's big, heavy, clunky, and badly needs a tune up. Not a fan of 29"" tires either. Just too cumbersome feeling on a tight trail. 

I feel like a decent HT would be a massive upgrade. I've been checking out the Commencal Meta HT AM Essential and it looks great. Seems like its a light aggressive bike. I like the low weight and simplicity of a HT. Would a HT be better for a beginner looking to improve my skills? 

I've also been looking on pinkbike for used bikes. I've found a few FS that look good. I'm hesitant on the FS bikes because I know they're much more maintenance and I'm looking at 4-5 year old bikes that cost more money that the new HTs I'm looking at. But it would probably be better for me as the trails around me are extremely rocky. Not much in the way of smooth trails to ride. It would also allow me to check out some bike parks in the area.

So finally I was able to get my bike out of the garage and I’m stoked. Repaired what needed to be repaired and I’m on the final steps. 

I already adjusted my front derailleur and am almost done with the rear derailleur too. 
I did this for the first time ever all by myself! 
Thanks to the park tools videos, they’re really great! 

Now the last thing that needs to be done is the b-screw. 

The video mentions that the distance between the cassette and the derailleur roll should be about 5-6 millimeters when shifted the the smallest cogs in the front and the back. 

But I have a BIG gap between them. Like 32 mm. 
And my chain isn’t under tension at all. By loosening the b-screw I could reduce the gap to about 17 mm, but at the cost of introducing even more slack to the system. 

What should I do? More slack and smaller gap?
Less slack and bigger gap? 

Taking out a couple chain links? I wouldn’t know how many and if it wouldn’t be too tight when for example being on the biggest and biggest cog.

I live in the PNW and plan on using a new bike as a ""do-everything"" kind of bike. Which, I know, is super un-original and hard to do.

I talked to my buddy about MTBs and he said, ""I would go FS and just spend the money up front."" After some research I found I'm nowhere near that price point for a decent FS down hill bike. 

I decided a solid Hard Tail would be the best option for riding on trails and taking to the streets when I decide to. But now I'm stuck in a limbo of finding bikes that might be too specific, with bad components, or not very upgrade-able.

I am comfortable riding down stairs and doing small bunny hops to get up and down curbs, so I'm somewhat experienced. But I would take input from people who are far more experienced than I am.

I've searched for used bikes on Facebook/PinkBike/Craigslist because they are all 26 inchers and I want the better momentum of the larger wheel sets.

I've been searching around for a couple weeks now trying to decide what kind of bike I want. I have a single speed bike in the garage that I don't really use because it doesn't have gears (which is funny because I bought a single speed for it's low maintenance). Now I want to get back onto a mountain bike. Problem is, the last bike I had was a department store bike and I haven't seen any trail time. 


**TL;DR** 
This what I have found for a potential bike. Can they be upgraded easily? Will they work both on and off the trail with street tires?
